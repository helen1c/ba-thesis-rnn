55, You dare to doubt me ? 
56," I'm sorry , sir . Let me transfer you to my supervisor . "
57,"Excuse me , sir , I'm afraid you can't park your car here . "
58, Why not ? It's my parking space . 
59," I'm afraid not , sir . "
60," Oh ? That's a surprise . Let me see ... D 0411 Our dog's birthday . Yes , I'm sure this my parking space ! "

104," So , do you think our corporation will be eligible for this ? "
105," Yes , and it's extremely simple . All you need to do is make a Network Settlement Agreement with us . "

108, Have you taken the key to the door ? 
109," Yes . Oh , dear , I can ’ t find my hairbrushes . Can you help me ? "
110, Where have you put it ? 
111, I put it in the dressing room . 
112, Are you sure ? 
113," Yes , quite sure . "
114," Then , have you looked downstairs ? "
115," Yes , I ’ Ve looked everywhere downstairs . "

125," I am sorry , sir . I have to give you a ticket . You can appeal to the court within 14 days . You will avoid paying the fine if you can prove that you are not at fault . "
126,Are you a goal-oriented person ? 
127," Yes , I am . I always make a plan before I do anything . "
128, Where do you want to be in 5 years ? 
129, I don't want to have a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing . 
130, That sounds very reasonable . 
131, It's the most important thing to me . 
132," If you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ? "
133, That obviously depends on how things go - - whether I'm suited to the firm and the firm to me . 
134, Tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them . 
135," I want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . In order to achieve this goal , I just want to work step by step . "
136, What is your long-range objective ? 
137, I haven't thought it over at all . 
138, What do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ?

140,I'd like to open a current account . 
141," Certainly . May I see your social security and your ID , please . "
142, Here you are . I wonder how much interest can I earn from a current account . 
143," Oh , current accounts don't pay out interest . "
144, Why is that ? 
145," It's primarily designed for business transactions . That is , writing checks to pay for bills , buying things and sending money . We won't expect a large amount of deposit in a current account . "
146, I see . How do I draw money for my own use then ? 
147,"Good morning , Helen . "
148," Good morning , Steven . "
149," So , what's the status of our advertising campaign ? "
150, It'll be a national campaign starting next week . 
151, What style will the ads be ? 
152," I suggest that we focus on slice of life , showing how you can beat the summer heat by biting into a cool ice-cream sandwich . "
153, Sounds like a good idea . Will we have a new slogan ? 
154, Definitely . 
155,I'd like to taste some local dishes . What would you recommend ? 
156, That's fine . You must try this dish . 
157, Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ? 
158, It's fish steamed and served with our special sauce . 
159, Is it good ? 
160, Sure . It's a most popular dish . 
161," I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together . "
162, We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ? 
163, What kind do you have ? 
164, We have French and Thousand Island . 
165, Make it Thousand Island . 
166,Taxi ! 
167," Where will you go , sir ? "
168, Friendship Hotel . 
169," OK , it's not far from here . "
170," I have something important to do , can you fast the speed ? "
171," Sure , I'll try my best . Here we are . "
172, How much should I pay you ? 
173, The reading on the meter is 15 yuan . 
174," Here's 20 yuan , keep the change . "
175, Thank you very much . 
176,Mr . Johnson ’ s office . Cindy speaking . 
177," Hi , Cindy . It ’ s Michael Kurt . Is Mr . Johnson in ? "
178," No , I ’ m sorry , Mr . Kurt . He ’ s stepped out for a bit . Would you like me to have him call you ? "
179," Yeah , that ’ ll be great . I ’ m on extension 4283 . "
180,"Hi , Mark . "
181," Hi , Bill . I ’ d like to take the apartment I looked at yesterday . "
182, All right . 
183," So , what do we do now ? "
184, This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords . 
185," Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ’ ll deposit one month ’ s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ’ s rent in advance . I understand that I ’ ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs . "
186," Yes . If you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out . "
187, Can I pay you by check ? 
188, Sure . A check will be fine . 
189, Is there a laundry room in the basement ? 
190, Yes . 
191, Can I sign the lease right now ? 
192,Good morning ! What can I do for you ? 
193, I'm thinking of travelling to Suzhou in July . Could you recommend some tourist programs for that ? 
194," With pleasure . We arrange two kinds of tourist programs for Suzhou , a six-day tour by train and a five-day flying journey . "
195, How much does a six-day tour by train cost ? 
196, Five hundred yuan . 
197, Does that include hotels and meals ? 
198," Oh , yes , and admission tickets for places of interest as well . "
199, That sounds reasonable . What about the five-day flying journey ? How much is that ? 
200, Eight hundred and fifty yuan . 
201, Covering all expenses ? 
202, Yes . But there is no half fare for children . They must pay full fare . 
203,I can't believe you wear jeans to the office ! Are you trying to lose your job ? 
204," Of course not . I'm just observing casual day . On Fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire . "
205, Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ? 
206," We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes . "
207, I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ? 
208," Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want . "
209, It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity . 
210," Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days . "
211,"ABC Company , my name is Lucy . How can I help you ? "
212," Hello , Lucy , this is Monica . I ’ m calling for the accountant position . I saw the information about the vacancy on your company ’ s website . Is it still available ? "

If all these is not problem for you , I recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly . "

217,Can I help you ? 
218," Yes , do you have any rooms available ? "
219, A single ? 
220, No . I need a double and three triples . My family is waiting for me in the car .

222, Ok ... Here you are . 
223, Here are your keys . Check out time is noon . 
224, Is breakfast included ? 
225, No . 
226,Why didn't you go to school yesterday ? 
227, I stayed home because I wasn't feeling well . 
228, What was your problem ? 
229, My stomach was bothering me . 
230, Are you feeling any better ? 
231, I'm still feeling a little sick . 
232," I'm going to the store , would you like any Pesto Pistol ? "
233, I'd appreciate that . 
234,"Excuse me , but please empty your pockets of all the metal things and put them in this tray . "
235, Including my keys ? 
236," Yes , and please step over there . "
237, All right . What shall I do now ? 
238, Just open your bags so we can check them . After that you can pick them up right behind that X-ray machine . 
239, I've got film in my bag . 
240, That's all right . This machine will not damage the film . 
241, That's fine . 
242, Can I have your boarding pass ? We need to stamp it . 
243, Sure . Here you are . 
244, Thank you . 
245, Am I through now ? 
246, Yes . Here is your boarding pass . 
247, Thank you and goodbye . 
248,"Welcome to Flash Foot , sir.How can I help you ? "
249, I ’ d like extra prints made of these photos . 
250, Do you have your negatives ? 
251, Yes.Here they are . I ’ Ve marked how many prints I want on each shot . 
252, What size do you want the prints ? 
253," Four by six , except this one . I want a ten by thirteen print of this one . "
254," Okay , they ’ ll be ready for you in an hour . "
255,Is there anything I can do for you ? 
256, I'm interested in taking a tour to Sydney .

258, How much does it cost ? 
259, $ 600 .

263," Like wise . Take a seat , please . How about a cup of tea ? "
264, Sure . Thank you . It seems your business is prosperous . There are many customers here . 
265," Yes , it's not too bad . Our sales are going up year after year . And we still have a large potential production capacity . "
266," Well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ? "
267," That's a good idea . So far , we have several agents abroad . "
268, We are willing to be your agent in Thailand for hand-held tools . What do you think ? 
269, That sounds good . 
270," Then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ? "
271," Usually , we give a commission of 4 % to our agents . "
272," 4 % is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4 % is not enough . "
273, Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase . 
274, You mean to saya 
275, It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ? 
276, We may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment . 
277," All right . If it's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately . "
278, Think it over . We hope to keep a good business relationship with you . 
279, Thank you for your help . 
280,I'm glad these batteries are on sale . 
281, I'm sorry . These batteries are not on sale . 
282, But that's what the ad said . 
283," I'm sorry . If you look at the ad again , you'll see that the other brand is on sale . "
284, Oh . You're right . I misread the ad . 
285," Yes , many people make that mistake . "
286," Well , you can't blame them . It's a confusing ad . "
287, You're right . Many ads are like that . 
288," Well , as long as I'm here . "
289," Just one second , and I'll give you the batteries that are on sale . "
290,"Hi , Jack , we are having a party tonight , wanna coming enjoy us ? You can bring your girlfriend , Tina . "
291, I don't have a girlfriend . I'm single . 
292," Oh , that's right . Well , there are going to be many beautiful girls at the party tonight , anyway . "
293," No , I like being single . I never thought lonely , I'm focus on my career . Maybe I'll start to look for my girl when I achieve success . "
294, Why is that ? 
295," Because I'm living a real world , a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money . Franklin speaking the girls I've met wounldn't married a man wounldn't make enough money . "
296," I agree , a man needs good career.But that doesn't mean he should have a little fun , too . "
297,"So , Casey , how are things going with the photos for the press kit ? "
298," Yeah , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about that . I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline . "
299, You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ? 
300," Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . . "
301, I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time ! 
302," I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures . "
303," I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP ! "
304,"Yes , sir ? "
305, Can I have Mr . J . Smith paged ? He said he'd be in the main dining room . I'm Mr . J . B . White .

315, Which one is best ? 
316, The cream form is very popular . 
317, Can I do anything else to help with the itching ? 
318, You could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker . 
319, I appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching . 
320," Anytime you have a question , please feel free to ask . "
321,Excuse me . Something is wrong with my bank card . Can you help me ?

325," OK , no problem . To err is human . "
326," Anyway , we apologize for the inconvenience we have brought you . Please just wait for a moment , and it will be fixed . "
327, Thank you very much . 
328,We are doing Secret Santa at the office again this year .

331, Booze ! 
332," Yeah , you ’ re right . Can ’ t go wrong with that . "
333,Is everything to your satisfaction ? 
334," No , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh . "
335," Oh , sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual . I will look into the matter . "
336, This is very annoying . 
337," I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course . "
338," No , I don't risk it . "
339," How about a delicious dessert then , with our compliment ? "
340, I'm not keen on dessert as a habit . They are fattening . 
341," I see , sir . I'm sure everything will be right next time you come . "
342,"Excuse me , are you Jane ? "
343," No , I'm Mary . "
344," Oh , are you in Class Four ? "

369,"You're looking rather pale , why ? "
370, I couldn't sleep well recently . 
371, You'd get plenty of sleep for you work so hard . 
372, I always drink too much wine in the evening . 
373, You shan't drink more wine in the evening . 
374," Yes , you are right . "
375, And you'd take some exercise every day . 
376, Many thanks for your advice . 
377,"Hello Mrs Parker , how have you been ? "
378, Hello Dr Peters . Just fine thank you . Ricky and I are here for his vaccines . 
379," Very well . Let's see , according to his vaccination record , Ricky has received his Polio , Tetanus and Hepatitis B shots . He is 14 months old , so he is due for Hepatitis A , Chickenpox and Measles shots . "
380, What about Rubella and Mumps ? 
381," Well , I can only give him these for now , and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest . "
382," OK , great . Doctor , I think I also may need a Tetanus booster . Last time I got it was maybe fifteen years ago ! "
383," We will check our records and I'll have the nurse administer and the booster as well . Now , please hold Ricky's arm tight , this may sting a little . "
384,I ’ m interested in teaching at your school . 
385, Great . Are you a qualified teacher ? 
386, Yes . 
387, What kind of teaching certificate do you have ? 
388, I have a TEFL certificate . 
389, How many years of experience do you have ? 
390, I have three years of teaching ESL and four years of teaching per-school children . 
391, When did you get your TEFL certificate ? 
392, I got my TEFL certificate three years ago . 
393, Why do you want to teach at our school ? 
394," Well , I ’ Ve heard many good things about it . I also like teaching young children . "
395, That ’ s great . Can you speak Chinese ? 
396," Yes , just a little . "
397, Can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10:00 ? 
398, I sure can . 
399, Great . See you then . 
400,Why is the car before us stopping ? 
401, What's going on ? 
402, Look . Two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . That's why that car stops . 
403, More and more people easily get irritated while driving . 
404, Yes . This is what is called road rage . 
405,"This is today ’ s schedule . At 8 thirty AM , conference with the department managers . At 9 o ’ clock , live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the staff for preventatives . "
406, That ’ s great . What are the prizes ? 
407, 3000 RIB as bonus for each person . 
408, To encourage the staff increases . 
409," Ok . Next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 AM . At 12 AM , back here for lunch . "
410, What about the afternoon ? 
411," At 2 PM , give a presentation here with the press . At four o ’ clock sharp , have dinner with Mr . Smith , manager of NCC . "
412,"This is Lincoln Bank , Consumer Credit Department . How can I help you ? "
413," Ah , hello . I'm calling to find out how I apply for a car loan . "
414, We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . The application process is pretty straight forward . I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ? 
415," Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account . "
416," The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ... "
417," Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want . "
418, That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ? 
419," Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB . "
420," What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . "
421," Yes , I have everything here . OK , I'll come in and see you later today . Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week ! How exciting ! "
422,"Hi , my name is Tom . "
423," Tom , the new sales representative ? Nice to meet you ! I'm Melinda . "
424, Nice to meet you too.Melinda . 
425," Now let me show you around . This is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . Over here is the sales department . "
426," Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small . "
427, Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there . 
428, It looks like you guys work hard . 
429," I tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.Just kidding . Oh , your cubicle is over the . And this way . Those are all private offices the managers offices . "
430, Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs . 
431, Sure thing . 
432,What do you think of our price ? 
433," Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? "
434," Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . "
435," I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable . "
436, I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level . 
437," I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % . "
438, I ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . 
439," Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ? "
440, We've already cut down our price to cost level . 
441, Is that all ? 
442," Yes , this is the best we can do . "
443, I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered . 
444,"So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ? "
445," It ’ s great , dad . I don ’ t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money . "
446," Even though you are only twelve , it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money . "
447, I ’ Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ’ t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ? 
448," You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest . "
449, But what if I need my money suddenly ? 
450," The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM . "
451, Great ! So it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters ! 
452, Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don ’ t have to worry about that yet . Let ’ s go make your first depot 
453, OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal . 
454,Is this where I can catch a bus to the theater ? 
455," Yes , but you can't get there with out a change . "
456, Which bus do I have to change ? 
457, You have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 . 
458, I see . Thank you . 
459,"Here we are , Joan . This is the Palace museum , also known as the Forbidden city . "
460," Oh , how splendid ! Can you take a picture of me here ? "
461, Sure . 
462,Excuse me . I'm afraid I got lost . Where am I on this map ? 
463," We are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city . "
464, Oh ! Can I go from here to the Zhongshan Park ? 
465, Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right . 
466,"Tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ? "
467, Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month . 
468, Is there anything else ? How about my salary ? 
469," Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record . "
470," Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ? "
471," All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days . "
472," Okay , that's good . I get it . "
473,"Kate , you never believe what's happened . "
474, What do you mean ? 
475, Masha and Hero are getting divorced . 
476, You are kidding . What happened ? 
477," Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce . "
478, That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ? 
479," Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out . "
480," That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ? "
481, Early in the New Year I guess . 
482,Overseas operator . 
483," I would like to make a collect call to Taipei , Taiwan , please . "
484," Your name , please . "
485, Tim Chen . 
486," What's the number , please . "
487," The area code is 2 , and the number is 2367-9960 . "
488, The line is connected . Please go ahead . 
489,Hello . Excuse me . 
490, Yes . Can I help you ? 
491, Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago . 
492, Of course I remember you . 
493, I think I lost my wallet here . 
494," Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything . "
495, Really ? You didn't find a wallet ? 
496," No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ? "
497," Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ? "
498, No . It's been empty the whole time . 
499, Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened . 
500," I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ? "
501, No . My friend did . 
502, Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ? 
503," No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table . "
504, Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home . 
505, I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ? 
506," Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that . "
507, Should I call the police ? 
508, You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets . 
509, Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home . 
510," I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir . "
511, Thanks for your help . 
512,"Good morning , young lady . You can call me Ma . Do you see anything you like ? "
513, Yes . Many things ! I especially love this beautiful quilt . 
514, That quilt was passed down to me from my ma in Holland . 
515, It sounds like a special quilt . Why do you want to sell it ? 
516," Well , this home is too big for me now , so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . Therefore , I need to part with a few things . "
517," Oh , I see . Umm , how much do you want for the quilt ? "
518, Is fifteen dollars OK ? 
519,Have you got change for a thousand ? 
520, Let me see . 
521,"May I come in , Mr Sun ? "
522," I ’ d rather you didn ’ t , Miss Yang . I ’ m very busy now . "
523, Can I try later then ? 
524," Yes , of course . "
525," Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ? "
526," Well , uh ... I ’ m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ? "
527, Do you mind if I sit down ? 
528, Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ? 
529, I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ? 
530, Yes . But why should you want to do that ? 
531, Do you mind if I speak frankly ? 
532, Not at all . Go ahead . 
533," Well . You see , I don ’ t like the office . I don ’ t like the staff . And I ’ m afraid of you . And I don ’ t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ? "
534, Yes . I ’ d be delighted if you did . 
535,Where is that ? 
536," Take me to the airport , please . "
537, Are you in a hurry ? 
538, I have to be there before 17 o'clock . 
539, We'll make it except a jam . You know it's rush hour . 
540, There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time . 
541, I'll do my best . 
542, Here's twenty dollars . 
543, Do you have small bills ? 
544," No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ? "
545, Here is your receipt . Thank you . 
546,Recently I have been getting headache and my eyes don't seems to see focus properly . 
547, When did you last time have your eyes checked ? 
548, Two years ago . At that time I had no problems.Now I can ’ t even make out something ten meters away . 
549," Come over here . I will test your eyes . First cover your left eye like this , and when I point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can , telling me which way the “ E ” points . "
550, All right . 
551, Good.Now the other eye . 
552," Well , this one is worse . "
553," Never mind , just read as far as you can . "
554, I can only read the first three lines . 
555,Is there a car park near the supermarket ? 
556," Yes , there is an underground car park near the supermarket . "
557, I see . Thanks . 
558,"Oh , come on , Ultraman ! "
559," What's up , Bro ? What's in the bulletin ? "
560, It says that there will be a blackout from 5 p . m . to 7 p . m . in our neighborhood today . 
561, Blackout ? Even the TV has the limit . 
562, Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ? 
563," Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either ! "
564," That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ? "
565," Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner ! "
566," OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here . "
567, How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ? 
568," Barbie ? You know , I might be seven , but I'm not a girl . "
569, Do you have a better plan ? 
570," All right , all right . "
571,"Yes , ma'am , how could I help you ? "
572, I am wondering if you do facial care ? 
573," Yes , we do . "
574, How much would it be ? 
575, From 200 to 800 . 
576, I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ? 
577, No problem . 
578,"Can I help you , Miss ? "
579, I would like to order 2 office-style cabinets and desk calendars . We want office-style cabinets in white . The catalogue number is 90 - f - 2356 .

599,"Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview . "
600, It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time . 
601," You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview . "
602, The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . And the length depends on the particular situation . 
603," Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation . "
604," To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression . "
605," Selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief . "
606, It should also be truthful and realistic . Do not blindly blow your own horn . 
607, You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for . 
608," While you should not omit your weak points , they need to be described appropriately "
609," Time permitted , you could add certain examples to your description . "
610," Besides , in the interview , it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly . "
611,Hello ? 
612," Hi , Deborah ! This is John . I'm calling from Australia . "
613, What are you doing in Australia ? 
614, I'm attending a conference in Sydney this week . Remember ? 
615," Oh , right . What time is it there ? "
616," It's 10:00 P . M . And it's four o'clock in Los Angeles , right ? "
617, Yes - four o'clock in the morning . 
618, 4:00 A . M . ? I'm really sorry . 
619, That's OK . I'm awake now . 
620,John hasn't turned up and Stefan is ill . Do we have anyone on stand-by ? 
621," I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement . "
622,"Jack , let ’ s go ! "
623," Oh , you are out of breath ! What happened ? "
624, Some people are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave here as soon as possible ! 
625, Take it easy . They will get caught . 
626,"Hello . May I speak to Jerry , please ? "
627," Sorry , but he is out for lunch right now . "
628, I see . Can you give me some idea how long he'll be back ?

630," That's nice . My name is Steven , my phone number is 6789777 . Okay , I'll be waiting for his call . Thank you and bye ! "
631," My pleasure , bye ! "
632,"Excuse me , Miss . "
633, What can I do for you ? 
634, I've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed . 
635, What's your flight number ? 
636, Flight CA216 to Chengdu . 
637," Yes , it's true . It has been delayed . "
638, Could you please tell me why ? 
639," Yes , of course . The delay is due to heavy rain . "
640, How long will the delay be ? Do you have any further information about it ? 
641," I am sorry , we don't know the extent of the delay at present . But according to the latest weather forecast , there will be a change in weather soon . "
642," We have to wait . Well , is it possible for the rain to stop before noon ? "
643, It's hard to say . Weather is so changeable in the summer . Please listen to the latest announcement about your flight . 
644," Yes , I will . Thanks a lot . Bye ! "
645, Bye 
646,What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! 
647," I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . "
648, I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! 
649, I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? 
650, I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . 
651," Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? "
652, I don't know . 
653," I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . "
654, What do you mean ? 
655," We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . "
656, I have plenty of gas . 
657," Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . "
658, So what can we do ? 
659," Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . "
660, Alright . That's a good idea . 
661, I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . 
662, Days ? 
663," Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . "
664," Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . "
665, Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . 
666,"Hey , buddy , can ’ t you see there ’ s a line ? "
667," Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t know . "
668, What ? You haven ’ t taken the bus before ? 
669," No , I ’ m afraid not . "
670," Well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . Besides , you should let old people on first . "
671, Sorry . 
672, It ’ s all right . Where are you going ? 
673, I wanted to see the White House . 
674," Oh , well you don ’ t want this bus , anyway . It goes to Georgetown . "
675," Oh , no . "
676," It ’ s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A . "
677," Oh , well thank you very much . "
678, You ’ re welcome . 
679,Can I help you ? 
680," I'd like the double cheese burger meal , please . "
681, What kind of drink would you like with that ? 
682, Just coke will be fine . 
683," Would you like a super size meal ? Only 2 RIB more , you'll get large coke and fries instead of medium . And today we are offering free toys all the meal boxes . "
684," That sounds good , thanks , I'd like that . Actually I'd like sprite instead of coke , thanks . "
685," That's not a problem , Miss . Will that be it ? "
686," Yes , that's all . "
687," That will be 25RMB , please "
688, You got it . 
689,Do you have any night tours ? 
690," Yes , we will depart in 10 minutes . "
691, Is that a guided tour ? 
692," Yes , it is . "
693, That's fine . Let's get on the bus . 
694,I am sure we will make it up as soon as possible . 
695, That's nice . 
696, We hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings . 
697, Of course not . We have cooperated for a long time . 
698,I would like to purchase some meat . 
699, What kind of meat would you like to get today ? 
700," First off , I'm going to need a pound of ground beef . "
701, A pound of ground beef is $ 2.48 . 
702, That's perfect . 
703, What else will you be needing ? 
704, I'm also going to need three pounds of chicken breasts . 
705, The chicken breasts cost $ 4.05 per pound . 
706, What's the total price for the chicken ? 
707, It's going to be $ 12.15 . 
708," Okay , I think that will be all for me today . "
709,I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks . 
710," Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us . "
711," Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market . "
712, Do you sell direct to shops ? 
713," Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen . "
714, Do you keep a stock of these things ? 
715," In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course . "
716," That is , your commission . "
717," Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal . "
718, Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission . 
719," The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much . "
720," According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? "
721," We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . "
722," We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ... "
723, Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? 
724," Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect . "
725," Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products . "
726," Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details . "
727," Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ? "
728," Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction . "
729," All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency . "
730, Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair . 
731,"Excuse me , I ’ m sorry to trouble you . My name is Susan Ransom , and I have placed several orders with you company . "
732," Yes , Mr . Ransom ? This is Karl Miller . How may I help you ? "
733," Well , I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month . It hasn ’ t arrived yet . "
734," Certainly , Ms . Ransom . Do you have an order number ? "
735,Have you worked out the offers . Mr . Thou ? 
736," Yes , we have . Here's our CIF quotation sheet . Please have a careful look . "
737, Are the prices on the list firm offers ? 
738, Yes . All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation . 
739, I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices . 
740," All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ? "
741, How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan . 
742, I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days . 
743,"Hello sir , may I help you ? "
744," Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet . "
745," I see . Well , you have come to the right place . We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers . "
746," Sounds good . I don ’ t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range . "
747," We have this new ETC smart phone.It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications . It also has a built-in camera , mp3 player and touch screen . It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are . "
748, What about Wi-fi ? 
749, Of course ! You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home . 
750, One last thing . Is it waterproof ?

752, Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty ! 
753, Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ? 
754," I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard ! "
755," What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog . "
756, Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ? 
757," We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house . "
758, Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome ! 
759," I ’ ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there . "
760, Yay ! 
761,"Good evening , Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ? "
762, Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ’ t understand . 
763, From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ’ s overbooked . 
764," I know what overbooked is , I just don ’ t understand how that could happen ? "
765," Actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats , "
766, So who has to stay behind ? 
767," Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone . "
768, Ok . I ’ ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket ! 
769,I want to rent this apartment . 
770, I ’ m glad to hear that . 
771, How much are you asking ? 
772, You will have to pay $ 1050 every month . 
773, I can ’ t afford that . 
774, What can you afford ? 
775, I was thinking $ 800 a month . 
776, I ’ ll need you to pay more than that . 
777, How much more ? 
778, How does $ 900 every month sound to you ? 
779, I can live with that . 
780, We have a deal then . 
781,"Good morning , Miss Monica . Nice to meet you again ! "
782," Good morning , Mr . Thomas , it is nice to see you too . "

785, The basic salary for your position in our company would be 4800 Yuan to start with increases giving according to your performance . 
786, It is a bit lower than I expected . But I can accept that . What are the working hours ? 
787," 40 hours a week , Monday to Friday , 9 AM to 5 PM with one hour lunch break every day .. "
788," Do I have to work on weekend ? If so , how do you pay for the overtime ? "
789," We do expect overtime work when it is necessary , but we pay twice of the work hour for working on weekends and three times for working on national holidays like Spring Festival and the Mid-Autumn Day . "
790, Is there probation ? 
791," No probation is involved . If you feel good , you can start next week . "

825,How does the political system work in your country ? 
826, We have hundreds of constituencies and the voters in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ’ s . 
827," Each mp belongs to a political party , right ? "

929," i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems . "
930," well , I didn't realize that . "
931," I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children . "

1409,So how can I make it ? 
1410, First you make a list of what you wanna buy ... 
1411, But I ’ Ve gotta have the budge before anything else . 
1412," Well , that ’ s a problem , isn ’ t it ? "
1413,Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ?

1433," I'm looking for a bookcase , but I don't want to buy a new one . "
1434, Are you having any luck ? 
1435, Not really . There aren't any used bookcases listed . But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday . I think I'll go to them . 
1436, Do you mind if I go with you ? 
1437, Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk . 
1438," I learned to negotiate from my mother . I thought I was pretty good at bargaining , but I had a problem the other day at Kimble's Department Store . "
1439, What happened ? 
1440," I wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . It was priced at forty dollars , so I started by offering the salesclerk thirty . "
1441,Do you do a lot of your shopping online ? 
1442," Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but lat "
1443, No . I ’ m a little worried about security . You never know who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ’ t you worry about that ? 
1444," Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to sho "
1445, I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological . 
1446," I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people . "
1447," So , how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet . "

1456, It ’ s as easy as pie . I always follow recipes . 
1457,Mr . Dick . Does the recommendation of the university play an important role ? 
1458," Yes . In fact , the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation . In the long period of cooperation , the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations , they trust each other well . If your university recommends you , you can be approved more easily . "
1459, But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . So I doubt its authority . 
1460," More and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . If your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you . "
1461, Could you tell me whether or not I send out my resume with it ? 
1462," It depends . If it has something special or useful , I suggest you send it out . "
1463,"Taylor , can you tell me how to apply for a job on the Internet ? "

1467, But I still don't know which unit is in need of staff . 
1468, Send out an application through Job-wanted on the website . 
1469, Can any unit see my information ? 
1470, It's a two-way choice . And your application will be read . 
1471, Which websites offer this service ? 
1472," Sina , 21st Century Talent Net , and a few others . "
1473, Thank you .

1475, I dare you to say that again .

1486, Tell me your argument . 
1487, I was pulled over for allegedly speeding . 
1488, Are you sure you weren't speeding ? 
1489," To be honest , I really wasn't . "
1490, What speed were you going ? 
1491," I was under the speed limit . I was going 35 , when the speed limit was 40 . "
1492," I'm just going to let you go , since the arresting officer isn't here . "
1493, What about my ticket ? Do I still need to pay ? 
1494, Don't worry about it . 
1495, I'm so glad for your help . 
1496,"Annie , do you like shopping online ? "
1497," Yes , I like it , because it's convenient . "
1498," Last week , I tried to buy a new cellphone online , but I didn't know how to pay for it . "
1499," First , you should open an account at the online bank . After that , you can buy anything you want online . "
1500, Are there many things online ? 
1501, Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let's check it out online ! ( They log in a shopping website . ) 
1502," That's amazing . Oh , an on line virtual supermarket ? "
1503, Let's click to check it out . 
1504," Oh , I got it . It simulates the real supermarket , which makes it feel so real . Mom will love it . She loves shopping in supermarkets . "
1505,"Ah , Bob . Just the person I wanted to see . "
1506, So what is it ? 
1507," You gotta help me out this time , buddy . "

1520," Would you please follow me , please ? "
1521, Thank you . 
1522, This is your table . It's Number 10 . 
1523,"Hello , ma ’ am . Can I help you ? "
1524, I ’ m looking for a sweater . 
1525, What size are you looking for ? 
1526," Well , I ’ m looking for size 10 but you don ’ t have it . "
1527, How about this one ? I think it looks terrific on you . 
1528," Yes , I like the color . Can I try it on ? "

1544,Are you ready to order ? 
1545, I think that we have a pretty good idea of what we would like to order . 
1546," Let me tell you about the specials of the day , which are chicken in a wine sauce with capers , and grilled garlic shrimp . "
1547, I was wondering if the chef could leave off the sauce . 
1548, The chef would be happy to accommodate your special requests . 
1549, I am a vegetarian . Do you have any vegetarian selections ? 
1550, You could choose the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza or the goat cheese and candied walnut salad . 
1551, I think that we will split the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza . 
1552," That is a good selection , and I can bring your salads now or serve them with your entree . "
1553, You can bring us our salads when you bring us our entree . 
1554,I can't open this email attachment our Paris office has sent me . 
1555, Are you sure you're using the right program ? 
1556," Well , yes it's definitely the same program but I might have the wrong version . Their system is newer than ours . "

1577, I can schedule you with him with no problem . We look forward to seeing you . 
1578,Wow ! What's the hold up ? 
1579, It ’ s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . Nobody sticks around in the summer . 
1580," Really ? Then , I guess I won ’ t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ? "

1620, Your price is higher than I expected . Could you give us a little discount ? 
1621, This is already our best price . 
1622, But the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order . 
1623," Well , what would you suggest ? "
1624, Could you make it $ 4500 ? 
1625, I'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price . This is the best price we can quote . 
1626, Can we meet each other half way ? 
1627, What do you mean ? 
1628," Let's close the deal at $ 4800 , OK ? "

1631," Yes , Ma'am . May I have your name and room number ? "
1632, My name is Terry . I stayed last night in your hotel in room 132 . 
1633, What kind of watch is it ? 
1634, It's a brand-new Seiko wrist watch . 
1635," Yes , we have it . "

1640," I think that the apartment looks very nice , but I do see some problems . "

1643, We will have the carpet cleaned before you move in . 
1644, You will ? 
1645," Yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ? "
1646, That was the only thing that I saw that was wrong with the apartment . 
1647, I ’ m happy that you find this apartment so appealing . 
1648, It is . I love it . 
1649,"That China-gown of Tang-Dynasty style is so beautiful . Would you show it to me , please ? "
1650, Absolutely . Here it is . 
1651, Could I try it on ? 
1652," Please do , the fitting-room is over there . "
1653, It feels a little tight around the waist . Do you have a bigger one ? 
1654, I'm sorry . We don't have this color in your size . We have some green ones in your size . Would you please have a look at this green one ? 
1655, OK . How much does it cost ? 
1656, It's 486 yuan . 
1657,"Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ? "
1658," As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap . "
1659," Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling . "
1660, So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide . 
1661," The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ? "
1662," To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken . "
1663," That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut . "
1664," I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion . "
1665," Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ? "
1666," Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ? "
1667, Good . Friday morning at 9 .

1676, Late night ? 
1677," Yeah , I got home around two . "
1678,"We've been waiting here for nearly ten minutes now , and there still isn't a bus in sight . "
1679, I'm afraid we'll be late for the party . 
1680," Have you got the time , Tom ? "
1681," Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch ! "
1682, But you bought it only last month . 
1683," Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired . "
1684, How long will it take us to get there ? 
1685, I think about ten minutes by bus . 
1686," It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain . "

1689, I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up . 
1690," Yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . You should have one every year . "
1691," I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ? "
1692," Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So try to come at least once a year for your own good . "
1693, Ok . 
1694," Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ? "
1695, Yes . 
1696," Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit . "
1697," I've tried hundreds of times , but I just can't seem to kick the habit . "
1698," Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I'll give you more information before you leave . "
1699," Ok , thanks doctor . "

1724, Good . You'll feel better after you do . 
1725,"Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please . "

1727, How long does it take to get there ?

1730," Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers . "

1734, Have a great trip . 
1735,I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend . 
1736, A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ? 
1737, The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend . 
1738, So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ? 
1739, It sounds like it will be . 
1740, I really hope it doesn't get cold . 
1741," That would ruin things , I want to go so badly . "
1742," The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know . "
1743, That is true . The weather is constantly changing . 
1744, It would be nice if the weather would never change . 
1745," That would be great , then we could plan things sooner . "
1746, True . Predictable weather would make life easier . 
1747,"Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . "
1748," If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . "
1749," Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . "
1750," But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency . "
1751, I doubt that . 
1752,Do you eat a lot of healthy food ? 
1753," Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind . "
1754," You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . "
1755, What's special about these things ? 
1756," Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled . "
1757, Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now . 
1758,"I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job . "
1759," You need to take a break , maybe a vacation . "
1760," Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . "
1761, Is that so ? 
1762," Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on . "
1763, Have you decided ? 
1764, Yes . I want to get a better job . 
1765, Could you tell me why you want to quit ? 
1766, I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues . 
1767," Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ? "
1768, I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay . 
1769," OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . "
1770, Thank you so much for your advice . 
1771, And every best wish for your new job . 
1772, Thank you . 
1773,The train is leaving . Hurry up ! Which car are we in ? 
1774," Let me see . Oh , No . 11 . "
1775," Here we are , Car 11 . Let's get in . "
1776, Seats No . 20 and 21 . It ’ s nice that we ’ Ve got a window seat . 
1777, Let's put our suitcases on the rack . 
1778," Oh , the baggage rack is full . Put them under the seat for the time being . "
1779, All right . 
1780,"So , how should we get to the theatre ? "
1781, Let's take the bus . 
1782," I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . "
1783, It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . 
1784," It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . "
1785," We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . "
1786," Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . "
1787," If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? "
1788," We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi . "
1789, I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus . 
1790, Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives . 
1791, It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you . 
1792," Thanks , that was nice of you . "
1793," See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip ! "
1794,Let's go over this plan again . 
1795," From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg . "
1796," And that is mostly flat , right ? "
1797," Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba . "
1798," And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ? "
1799, That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop . 
1800," It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride . "
1801, Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ? 
1802,"Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? "
1803, I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her . 
1804," I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet . "
1805," Anyhow , I'd like to change our room . "
1806," No problem , sir . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from . "
1807, All right . I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep . 
1808," Be sure . I'll make a note of that . Everything will be taken care of . And if there is anything more you need , please let us know . "
1809,It's time for bed . 
1810, I'm not ready to go to sleep . I'm not tired . 
1811," It's quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow . "
1812, I'm not going to be able to fall asleep . 
1813, Why don't you try counting sheep ? 
1814, I've tried that before . It really doesn't work . 
1815," That's beside the point , you still need to go to bed . "
1816, Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep ? 
1817," If I let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night . "
1818, I promise I'll go to sleep soon . 
1819," No , you're going to sleep now , so good night . "
1820, See you in the morning . 
1821,"I see myself as being honest , diligent , persevering and creative . And I have a strong sense of responsibility . "
1822, How about your psychological resilience ? 
1823," I think I can work well under pressure , if necessary . "
1824, How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ? 
1825," I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way . "
1826, You seem to be a kind-hearted lady . 
1827, Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature . 
1828, Please tell me your weaknesses if you can . 
1829, I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection . 
1830,Karen ? I need to go over a few things with you . 
1831, Certainly . Mr . Graham . When would you like to meet ? 
1832," I was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting . "
1833, Fine . At 3:30 ? 
1834,I believe we ' Ve met before . My name's David . 
1835," Yes , at your company , I think . I'm Frank . "
1836," Oh , I remember now.Very nice to meet you again . "
1837," Nice meeting you , too . "
1838,I made my little brother cry . 
1839, Shame on you ! 
1840,I need some mascara . Do you have good thickening mascara ? 
1841, Of course . Here is our thickening mascara . We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes . 
1842, Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too . Do you have a color chart can look at ? 
1843, We have a very wide selection of colors . And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . So it is very gentle on your eyelids . Would you like to sample some ? 
1844," Oh , sure I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first . "
1845, I can help you with that . 
1846, Thank you . 
1847,Is this the baggage claim area for flight KB256 ? 
1848," Yes , we are on the same plane . "
1849, But I am a transfer passenger . I have a connecting flight to Miami . 
1850, So you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area . 
1851, Yes.It ' s quite troublesome . 
1852, Why not go and find a porter ? 
1853,"Billy , you don ’ t look too well . Maybe you should take the day off school . "
1854, But Mom ! Today we ’ re playing football ! I love football ! 
1855, You ’ Ve got a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ’ s that on your arm ? 
1856, I don ’ t know . It was there when I woke up this morning . 
1857, It ’ s rash . I ’ d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ? 
1858, I bashed it against the chair in my room . 
1859, Does it hurt ? 
1860," A little , but not much . "
1861, Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ’ ll take you to the doctor ’ s after breakfast . 
1862," If I ’ m better this afternoon , can I go to school ? "
1863," If you are better , but I doubt you will be . "
1864,This is your schedule . 
1865," You're going out of your way for us , I believe . "
1866, You are our honored guests . 
1867,Are there any vacancies still available ? 
1868, Yes . We need a plumber here . 
1869," I am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager . "
1870, I am sorry . They are not available now . 
1871,"My name is Mary , and I will be your waitress tonight . "
1872," Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant . "
1873," Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ? "
1874," Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ? "
1875, There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table . 
1876, The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ? 
1877," You know , that is one of my favorites ! "
1878," OK , I'll take one order of that . "
1879, You could choose another appetizer for half price to share . 
1880, Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings . 
1881,I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there's something wrong with the fax machine . 
1882, What's wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ? 
1883," Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ? "
1884," Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out . "
1885,"I would like to speak to you , if you don ’ t mind . "
1886, What would you like to speak to me about ? 
1887, I would like to talk to you about this year ’ s election . 
1888, Is that right ? 
1889, I am a volunteer for this year ’ s campaign . 
1890, That ’ s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand . 
1891," I know history is about to be made , and I would like to be a part of it . "
1892, That ’ s fantastic . 
1893, Are you planning on voting ? 
1894, I ’ m going to vote . 
1895, Go to your polling place early on Election Day . 
1896, I will . Good luck with your volunteering . 
1897,We hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future . 
1898, Yes . I promise it will not happen again . 
1899, We look forward to your settlement at an early date . 
1900, We will inform you as soon as possible . 
1901,"Hello , Steven . How do you get along with your job ? "
1902," Actually , I learn many things from it . I find that I am a quick learner in new things . "
1903," Practice makes perfect . By the way , what do you learn from your job ? "
1904," At first I didn't know anything about the machine . Now I know how to operate it . Besides , the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement . "
1905," Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance . "
1906, Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job . 
1907, I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work . 
1908," OK , let's go . "
1909,Where on earth are we ? 
1910," Judging by all the traffic , I'd say we're near the outskirts of the city . "
1911, What did I do wrong ? Did I take a wrong turn ? 
1912," I'm not sure , but I think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge . "
1913," Well , now we should turn back a few kilometres . "
1914, It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map . 
1915,Hello . Front desk . 
1916, Yes . This is Bob Robinson . I ’ m calling from room number 627 . 
1917," Hi , Bob . What can I do for you ? "
1918, Is it possible to change to another room ? 
1919, Could you please tell me why ? 
1920, My room is facing the swimming pool . It ’ s noisy for me . I have a problem sleeping . And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator . 
1921, So you need a quiet side room on the lower floor . 
1922, You ’ re right . 
1923, Okay . Let me check for a room on the first floor . 
1924, Thank you . 
1925, I ’ Ve only two rooms on the first floor . How about room 108 ? 
1926, That ’ s fine . Can I move now ? 
1927, Sure . I ’ ll send the bellman to help you . 
1928," Oh , thank you kindly . "
1929, You ’ re welcome . 
1930,How long will it take for our order to be delivered ? 
1931," Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles . "
1932," Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control . "
1933," No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go . "
1934,"Now you're my boss , Mr . Henry . "
1935, Do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? 
1936," No , nothing in particular . "
1937," You may ask questions about us , if you have any . "
1938, All right . When can I start ? 
1939,What are you doing here today ? 
1940, I would like to fight my ticket . 
1941, Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today ? 
1942," Yes , the officer is here today . "
1943, What's your case ? 
1944," I was pulled over for running a red light , but I never did . "
1945, Do you believe that the officer lied ? 
1946," There was a camera on the signal . So , he was obviously lying . "
1947, Your license plate was caught on camera ? 
1948, A picture of my license plate was never taken . 
1949," Since there is no picture of your license plate on record , I'm going to let you go . "
1950, Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me . 
1951,"Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ? "
1952," Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long . "
1953," Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices . "
1954, That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options . 
1955," What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ? "
1956," Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into . "
1957," So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ? "
1958," Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection . "
1959," Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will . "
1960," After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice . "
1961,what shall we do after the volleyball match ? 
1962, how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym . 
1963, that's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family . 
1964," me , too . What did you have in mind ? "
1965," I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must . "
1966," I agree . They're very lovely , especially "" Huan Huan "" . "
1967," is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ? "
1968," the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive . "
1969," oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ? "
1970, I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now . 
1971, any other ideas ? 
1972," there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts . "
1973, it all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have . 
1974,Mom ! I hate eating vegetables ! 
1975, You don ’ t have to eat them . I don ’ t mind . 
1976, Thanks mom ! Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake ! 
1977, No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables . 
1978, But I don ’ t like them ! It ’ s not fair ! 
1979," You can have some fruit for dessert . If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake . "
1980," Ok ... actually , I don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots , buy I hate broccoli and cauliflower . "
1981," I ’ ll remember that for next time . You ’ ll get extra peas and carrots , buy no broccoli or cauliflower . OK ? "
1982, Thanks mom ! 
1983,It was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place . It gave me a good idea of your product range . 
1984," It ’ s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . What ’ s your general impression , may I ask ? "
1985," Very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your NW Model . "
1986, That ’ s our latest development . A product with high performance . We put it on the market just two months ago . 
1987," The machine gives you an edge over your competitors , I guess . "
1988, Certainly . No one can match us as far as speed is concerned . 
1989, Could you give me some brochures for that machine ? And the price if possible . 
1990, Right . Here is our sales catalog and literature . 
1991, Thank you . I think we may be able to work together in the future . 
1992,Is the factory fully-automated ? 
1993, Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually . 
1994, What about supply of parts to the production line ? 
1995," Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line . "
1996, What about the smaller components ? 
1997, They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory . 
1998,I'm glad you're on your ten-year reunion planning committee . 
1999," Yeah , you get the TV to yourself while I spend my nights surfing the Net for missing classmates . "
2000, That's not why . This way I can see how you guys do this sort of thing . 
2001, I guess . Don't you have reunions in Taiwan ? 
2002, Definitely . Every year . But just for our forty-person class . 
2003, Ours are for everyone that graduated in the same year . 
2004,What does your job involve ? 
2005, I'm the Project Manager so I have to make sure our projects run smoothly . I work with three Project Engineers . They take care of after-sales service and look after the maintenance side of the business . 
2006,How many languages can you speak ? 
2007," Besides Chinese , I can speak English and French . "
2008, You mean you can read and write both of them ? 
2009," No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French . "
2010, Can you read and write English well ? 
2011, I can speak the language better than read and write . 
2012, Do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of English-speaking countries ? 
2013, I think so . I used to be an interpreter . 
2014, Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work ? 
2015, The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm . 
2016,What can I get for you ? Here is the menu . 
2017," Let me have a look . Well , how many kinds of steaks do you have ? "
2018," We have sirloin steaks , pepper steak , and filet steak . "
2019, Is there something go with the filet steak ? 
2020," Yes , we have various sauces . What about the gravy ? "
2021,Are you ready to go shopping ? 
2022, Just a minute . I need to make a list of thinks that we need . 
2023," Good idea . Have you written down potatoes , carrots , and onions ? "
2024, I don ’ t have onions on my list . I ’ ll add them . We should get some tea . Is green tea ok or should we get the same tea that we usually get ? 
2025, Let ’ s get both . We need some coffee too . Is that on your list ? 
2026," Yes , it is . Here ’ s my list . Is there anything that I ’ Ve forgotten ? "
2027, I think you ’ Ve got everything . I want to got some chocolate and some cheese . 
2028, What kind of cheese do you want . 
2029," I ’ m not sure . I ’ ll decide at the cheese counter , when I can see what they have . Have we got enough money ? "
2030," We don ’ t have enough cash , so I ’ ll take my credit card and we can pay with that . Where are the car keys ? "
2031, I ’ Ve got them there . Shall I drive ? 
2032,"Hello , can you tell me how to use the telephone ? "
2033," If you want to order meals , call 8801.If you need other help , call 8803 and someone will be there . "
2034," Thank you so much . By the way , is there a mail service ? "
2035," Yes , you can take your letters to the counter over there . "
2036,"Hi , I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . A technician has just come and checked it . He will bring me a new one tomorrow . It seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . Can I use the one in your office ? "
2037, Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ? 
2038," Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ? "
2039," Yes , it will print immediately . "
2040,How many years have you done business with China ? 
2041," Let me see , about five years , we established our business relationship with Hua Mei of China Import & Export Corporation in 2003 . "
2042, Do you have any difficulties in doing business in China ? You know the Chinese economic legislation is still incomplete ? 
2043," I don't think I have any problem with our Chinese partners . They have always followed the contract strictly . We can do business directly with the corporation . As I mentioned before , the Chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law . Its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies . "
2044," Well , it's known that the Sino-American relation is in a dilemma . Does it influence your business in China ? "
2045, Actually not at present . But we are afraid it will . You know policies influence business to some extent . I hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists . China is really a large market . We don't want to lose it . 
2046, Thank you . 
2047, You're welcome . 
2048,"Give me a pack of first-class stamps , please . "
2049, Here you are . That will be five dollars . Anything else ? 
2050, Yes . I want some post cards and some airmail stamps . I want to send some letters to South America . 
2051," Just a moment , I'll look up the rate for air-mail letters to South America . "
2052," Can you tell me how much it will cost to send a package to Colombia ? Also , I what to know how long it will take . "
2053, Do you have the package with you ? I would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost . 
2054, Do you insure package ? 
2055, Yes . All you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for . 
2056, Is there a way that I can be sure that the people in South america receive my package ? 
2057," The post office rarely loses package . You can , however , request a rectum receipt . "
2058, One last question-what are your hours ? 
2059, We open at eight-thirty in the morning and close at five-thirty in the afternoon . 
2060," Thank you , you helped me a lot . "
2061,"Hello , thank you for taking the time to interview me . "
2062," Hi there , I ’ m Bill Gotcha , the owner of Gotcha Enterprises . Did you find your way here OK ? "
2063, Your assistant gave wonderful directions . 
2064, Why are you switching jobs at this point in your career ? 
2065, Our Company is moving overseas and I wish to stay in the United States . 
2066, What are you best at ? 
2067, I am good at organizing systems that have been having problems . 
2068, What is your biggest challenge in terms of skills ? 
2069, I don ’ t like to sit around and so like to always find things to do to keep myself busy . 
2070, That is good to hear ! 
2071,Good morning . SRC international . How may I help you ? 
2072, Good morning . I'd like to speak to Peter . Chen Please . 
2073, Certainly . Who should I say is calling ? 
2074, This is Tim . Hunter from Hunter industries . 
2075, And what is it regarding please ? 
2076, We have an appointment for this afternoon . Mr . Chen will know why I'm calling . 
2077," Of course , Please hold the line Mr . Hunter . "
2078,"Right , let me run through your options . You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to , but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan . "
2079," OK , what does that entail ? "
2080," It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances . "
2081," Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ? "
2082," Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate . "
2083," I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ? "
2084," Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu . "
2085," Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today . "
2086,My aunt told me one of her secrets--cellophane tape . 
2087, I just got it at the special health store . It's for my flabby arms . 
2088, Let me know how it works . 
2089," I have to say , I have had enough of this roller coaster . "
2090, I know what you mean . I'm like a yo-yo . 
2091, Last week I was down to 60 kilos . This week I had one donut more . Now I'm up to 62 kilos . 
2092,"May I have a menu , please ? "
2093, Of course . 
2094, Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ? 
2095, Lobster ? It is steamed and served with our special sauce . 
2096, Is it good ? 
2097, Sure . It is a most popular dish . 
2098," I think I will try some lobster , and give me some green salad together . "
2099,"Can ’ t you come in and have tea now , Peter ? "
2100," Not yet , I must water the garden first . "
2101, Do you have to water it now ? 
2102, I ’ m afraid I must . Look at it ! It ’ s terribly dry . 
2103, What a nuisance ! 
2104," Last summer it was very dry , too . Don ’ t you remember ? I had to water it every day . "
2105," Well , I ’ ll have tea by myself . That was quick ! Have you finished already ? "
2106," Yes , Look out of the window . "
2107, It ’ s raining . That means you needn ’ t water the garden . 
2108," That was a pleasant surprise . It means I can have tea , instead . "
2109,"I'm broke , and I have to catch another bus . "
2110, Why don't you have any money for another bus ? 
2111, I got hungry and bought some chips . 
2112, That was smart . 
2113," Anyway , do you have any change I can use for the bus ? "
2114, I don't have any . 
2115, I don't know how I'm going to get home . 
2116, Get a transfer from the bus driver . 
2117, How much is a transfer ? 
2118, It doesn't cost anything . 
2119, That's great ! Thanks for your help . 
2120, You know what ? Don't mention it . 
2121,"Hello , Anna . Come in and sit down . "

2141, Thank you . I think today we will go there . 
2142,"You're here to make a deposit , is that correct ? "
2143," Right . I'd like to deposit 2,000 RIB into my Current Account . "
2144," No problem . Could I have the cash and your Bank Book , please ? Oh dear ... there seems to be some problems here ... "
2145, What ? What's wrong ? 
2146," I'm sorry but 5 of these notes seem to be counterfeit . Look at this watermark , do you see it ? "
2147," It does look a little strange , I didn't notice that before . "
2148,"Hello , sir . Is there anything I can help you find ? "
2149," Um ... Uh ... I'm just looking , thanks . "
2150, Need a gift for your girlfriend or wife ...

2156,An idea about killing time on a train ? 
2157, I advise you to read Playboy.You can get a lot from it . 
2158, But there's quite a lot of rumors about it . 
2159, That's why it's interesting . 
2160,Have you brought the receipt with you ? 
2161," No , I don't . I left it home . "

2190, Are you often traveling by plane ? 
2191," No , this is the second time . "
2192, That's right . It's normal if you don't often take the plane . Just relax a little bit . 
2193, Why this happens to me when I am on the plane ? I feel bad . 
2194," Don't worry , sir . It's just because of the lower pressure . "
2195, What should I do about it ? 
2196, You may feel much better if you chew some gum or peanuts . 
2197," OK , thanks . Does it work really ? I'll give a try . "
2198, Are you feeling better now ? Do you need some pills ? 
2199, Much better . Thank you . I just feel tired but I can't fall asleep . 
2200," So , you'd better wear this eyeshade and you will sleep well . "
2201, I am not used to wearing that . Thanks .

2220, Do you have any form of ID ? 
2221, I have my Tennis Club card . Is that good enough ?

2225," OK , I ’ ll fill out the form and come right back . "
2226,"Hello , how can I be of service ? "
2227, Hello . I'm not sure who I need to speak to . I got this 50 yuan note today and it seems a little odd to me . 
2228, The first thing we do is check the feel of the paper ;d oes it feel too thick or too thin ? Then we check the watermark . In my opinion it is counterfeit . I'll just run it through the scanner to double check . 
2229, What happens now ? 
2230," Well , it's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . So , unfortunately you'll lose this 50 RIB . We'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated . "
2231,"Dear , can you drive me to the clinic ? "
2232, I'm afraid I can't . 
2233, Why ? 
2234," Well , my car won't start . I don't know what's the matter with it . "
2235, Could it be the battery ? 
2236," No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago.It must be other problems . "
2237," Well , I suppose it could be the gas . "
2238," No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday . "
2239, Perhaps it's the starter then ? 
2240," Yes , that's possible . "
2241,"What do you reading , Linda ? "
2242," I'm reading a novel , The mill on the floss , written by the famous novelist gorge alias . "
2243, What's it about ? 
2244," It's meanly about relationship between a brother and a sister , who live in the mill on the river floss . It describe there are childhood and disputes cause them to separate , the book ends with them ha "
2245, Is it difficult to understand ?

2248, I really like short stories . 
2249, Have you read anything else besides literature ? 
2250," Certainly I have . I like to read books on vary subjects , and i can read everything I can get my hands on in my spare time . I don't want to idle away and waste my time . "
2251, I agree . People who don't read are no better often people who can't read . I also agree that books are like food for the mind . 
2252,We have three dressings for salad . Which one would you like ? 
2253, What kind do you have ? 
2254," We have Italian , French and Thousand Island . "
2255, Make it French please . 
2256,I saw a vacancy board outside for assistant . Has the vacancy been filled ? 
2257, Not yet . But do you have any experience as an assistant ? 
2258, Yes . I have a lot of experience in that . I have worked for the sales company as an assistant since finishing my university . 
2259, OK . It sounds fine . 
2260,Can I help you ? 
2261," I'd like to have a look at your air conditioners . Hum , this one looks pretty good . "
2262," Yes , it ’ s this summer ’ s best-seller . "
2263, And what about your customer service ? 
2264, We provide free delivery and installation . 
2265, How long is the warranty ? 
2266, It is two-year and covers parts and service . 
2267, Very good . I ’ ll take it .

2269," Oh , that must be me ! Probably they typed the name wrong.My husband's English isn't so good . "
2270," Yes , sometimes it happens , Ma'am . That's why it is always good to carry your confirmation number . I'm sorry about the inconvenience . "
2271, It's okay . It's probably my husband's fault.Is there a pool in this hotel ? 
2272," Yes , of course.The pool is open until 10:00 p . m . So you still have about 45 minutes . "
2273, Good .

2275, Thank you . 
2276,"Excuse me , I need to get to Cambridge today . "
2277, Would you like to go by train or by bus ? 
2278," I am not sure , which one is better ? "
2279, The bus is cheaper but also slower . It will take about two-and-a-half hours . 
2280, And how long does the train take ? 
2281," If you take the fast train , it will take about 50 minutes . "
2282, Where do I catch the train ? 
2283, The trains for Cambridge leave from King's Cross Station . They run approximately every half hour . Most trains to Cambridge go from Platform 9 . 
2284, How do I get to King's Cross ? 
2285, The best way is to take an underground tube train directly to King's Cross . The Underground station is just round the corner from here . 
2286, Can you show me on the map ? 
2287, It is very easy . Just turn right when you leave and then turn right again at the first crossroads . The entrance to the Underground station is about 50 meters further on . 
2288, Thank you very much . 
2289, You're welcome . 
2290,Have you seen the sales report for last quarter ? Who do you think is our digest threat ? 
2291," From the numbers , it seems like Forest Inc . is our digest competitor ... Le'Ban and Markford are also major contenders in our market . "
2292," Le'Ban is the new kid on the block , it's amazing they've had such tremendous success so soon ... With them on the scene , the competition is outthrough . "
2293, here's information about our competitor's recent market activities ... 
2294," Thanks , this will be a big help in putting together next quarter's marketing strategies . With competition this intense , we'll have to step up production even more . We need a price we can compete with . "
2295, We're in a very competitive environment . It's sink or saimin this market . 
2296, Better start swimming ! we've got to find a way to outsmart the other guys . I want a preliminarily strategic marketing plan on my desk by next Tuesday ... the competition never sleeps and neither should we . 
2297,"Hello , this is Hilton Hotel . How may I help you ? "
2298, Hi . I would like to make a reservation on this Friday . 
2299," OK . What kind of room do you want ? We have single rooms , twin rooms , double rooms and suites available on Friday . "
2300, I want a single room with ocean view . Do you have one ? 
2301, Let me check . Yes . 
2302, OK . I will take it . 
2303, When do you check in ? How long are you planning to stay ? Do you have any special requirements ? 
2304, I guess I am going to arrive at 9:00 in the morning and I would like to leave at 200 in the afternoon on Sunday . Please give me a room away from the elevator . I hate noises while I am sleeping . 
2305, OK . No problem . 
2306,We need to call an emergency meeting as soon as possible about this . 
2307, OK . Let me send a memo around . 
2308," Schedule it for this afternoon , when Ken gets back . "
2309, I don ’ t think he ’ s back today . 
2310," Oh , that ’ s right . Go ahead anyways . I ’ ll fill him in . We can ’ t lose this order under any circumstances ! "
2311," I know , it ’ s a big one . "
2312,Would you mind if I ask some personal questions ? 
2313, No . I don ’ t . Please . 
2314, Are you in robust health ? 
2315," I have a little problem , I'm overweight for my height . I think I should go on a diet . "
2316,The consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us . We have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality I am afraid . 
2317, Is there anything wrong ? 
2318," We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard . "
2319, It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ? 
2320, Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally 
2321," Well . According to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . We ’ ll send our technicians to repair them . "
2322," Forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . You should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee . "
2323," I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee . "
2324, All right . In that case we are still willing to do business with you . 
2325,"Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday . "
2326, Oh where was that ? 
2327, I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track . 
2328, Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . She is always making us kids eat the proper foods . 
2329," Well , it pays off for her . How old is she anyway ? "
2330, She will be 86 next month . 
2331, That is truly amazing ! 
2332,Did you punch in ? 
2333," Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable ! "
2334, Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it . 
2335," Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ? "
2336," Sure , when those never ending meetings . "
2337,"I don't think you've met my sister , Mary . "
2338," No , I haven't had the pleasure . "
2339, Come and meet her now . 
2340, All right . 
2341,"Excuse me , would you tell me how to return to Hilton Hotel . I'm afraid I lost my way . "
2342, Did you have hotel card or something ? 
2343," Let me see . Yes , I have the address and hotel telephone number here . "
2344," Oh , you stay at the down town Hilton . When you go down two blocks this way and turn left , you will find it on your right . "
2345, I don't understand very well . Could you give me a map ? 
2346,The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ? 
2347, I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself . 
2348," So , let ’ s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ’ t they ? "
2349," Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced . "
2350, How long did it take you to do the tiling . 
2351," As I hadn ’ t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether . "
2352, I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ? 
2353," You ’ ll be lucky ! However , I ’ ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself . "
2354,"I'd like to see that pen , please . "
2355, You mean this one ? 
2356," No , the other one in the brown case . "
2357," Oh , this one ... Here . "
2358, May I try it ? 
2359, Sure . 
2360, It's very smooth . I'll take it . 
2361, Cash or charge ? 
2362," Charge , please . "
2363,I ’ Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles . 
2364," We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days . "
2365," Why , your price has soared . It ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price . "
2366, I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere . 
2367, I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources . 
2368, But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries . 
2369," I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ’ t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years . "
2370," There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price . "
2371," Well , we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ’ ll have to try , I suppose . "
2372,Good morning.sir.My name is Liu Peng from Tsinghai University . I am here for the interview relating to my visa application .

2776, I always have trouble with jet lag .

2793," All right , then . I ’ ll see you at noon on Wednesday . "
2794,I've got a temperature and my stomach hurts . 
2795, How long have you been feeling this way ? 
2796, It all started the day before yesterday . 
2797, You seem to have picked up some kind of infection . 
2798, What should I do ? 
2799, Take a few days off from work and don't wear yourself out . 
2800,What would you like to eat tonight ? 
2801," I'm not sure , what about you ? "
2802, Do you think Kentucky fried chicken is good ? 
2803, Sure sounds good to me . 
2804,Did you clean your room today ? 
2805," No , not yet . "
2806," Well , when were you planning on doing that ? "
2807, I'm going to clean it up later . 
2808, Didn't I ask you to clean it up earlier ? 
2809, I'm going to clean it . 
2810," I want you to vacuum in your room , and don't forget to dust everything . "
2811, I know . I'll do it . 
2812, Make sure you clean it up before you do anything else . 
2813," I'm not going anywhere until later , so I'll clean it then . "
2814,"Hello , can I help ? "
2815, I'm from Lexington Software and I'm here to collect an export L / C . 
2816, I have it right here . 
2817, Great . Can I take it with me now ? Or do you need me to fill in some forms or something ? 
2818," No , you can take it away now . I just need you to sign here . "
2819, Here you are . 
2820," Just one thing before you go , could you please prepare your documents in accordance with the L / C within the validity period ? "
2821," No problem , I'll get on that right away . Thanks , bye . "
2822,"Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ? "
2823, What do you need ? 
2824, I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him . 
2825, He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves . 
2826,I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable ! 
2827," Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him . "
2828, He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . 
2829, I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . 
2830," I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . "
2831, Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss . 
2832," Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . "
2833," Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper . "
2834, I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ? 
2835, I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions . 
2836,"hey , you look great ! how's everything ? "
2837," yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit . "
2838, really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work . 
2839, it's important to do proper exercises . 
2840, you're right . Too much or too little won't do any good . 
2841," the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet . "
2842, sounds reasonable . 
2843, we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic . 
2844, and fruits ! 
2845, surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness . 
2846, I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ? 
2847," yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can help one to keep sound physical health . "
2848," I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track . "
2849, you bet it ! 
2850,"Staying out all night , you frightened me to death . "
2851, I stayed with my friends . 
2852, You should at least give me a call . 
2853," I'm sorry , Mum . "
2854,Did anyone call ? 
2855, Just Mr . White . 
2856, What did he want ? 
2857, He wouldn't say over the phone . 
2858,What kind of job do you intend to do ? 
2859, I want to do some management job since I have three-year's work history . 
2860, What are your plans if you were hired ? 
2861, I would apply my specialty and experience to my job and gradually move up to the management level in this company . 
2862,You stepped on my foot ! 
2863, Sorry . I didn't mean to . 
2864,what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ? 
2865," while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement . "
2866, why not ? 
2867, the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing ! 
2868, it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking . 
2869," I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children . "
2870, I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking . 
2871, all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty . 
2872," perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow . "
2873," I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them . "
2874, that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad . 
2875," you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking . "
2876,Good morning . Could I speak with Mr . Willard please ? 
2877," This is he . Who ’ s calling , please ? "
2878, This is Chris Emerson speaking . 
2879," Hello , Chris . How can I help you ? "
2880,"Can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum , Miss Thong ? "
2881, Certainly . A letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted . A memorandum is a communication within an organization . 
2882, Should we use the layout we use for a letter when we write a memorandum ? 
2883," No , not necessary . Usually we have a set form which is printed . We just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company . "
2884," Of course , let me find one for you . "
2885,"Hi , do you have any tickets for the show tonight ? "
2886," Sorry , it ’ s all sold out . "
2887," Well , do you have any for tomorrow ? "
2888, We have tickets for the matinee . It starts at 3p . m . 
2889, Ok . I ’ ll take it . 
2890, Where would you like to sit ? 
2891," Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes . "
2892, Certainly . 
2893,"Lily , I am terribly sorry about this . But we have to put off or cancel tomorrow's meeting . "
2894, Cancelled ? That's just can't happen ! 
2895," Sorry to say , but nothing can be done . The equipment broke down and can't be fixed till Friday . "
2896," Oh , I hope it be fixed on Friday . "
2897,"Overseas operator , may I help you ? "
2898, Yes . I would like to place a collect call . 
2899, Can you tell me the name and number of the person you want ? 
2900, Terry and his number is 4562325 8 . 
2901, Please wait a moment . It Will take a few seconds to get through . 
2902,Would you help me figure out what to do about the office party ? 
2903," I would be happy to help . What would you like me to help with , food or entertainment ? "
2904, I would like to help you with both . 
2905," That will work out fine . To make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ? "
2906, A dressy party would be fun ! 
2907, That will work out fine . Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best ? 
2908, We should probably have both . 
2909," Yes , that will work out fine . Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ ? "
2910, Maybe we could do both ! 
2911, Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details . 
2912,I can't find the price tag . 
2913, It's right here . $ 100 . 
2914, But I heard other stores were having great mark-downs on this item . 
2915, Ours are of really good quality . 
2916," I see , please wrap it . "
2917,"Peter , how often do you exercise ? "
2918," Well , I swim and run every day . "
2919," Now , tell me , what do you eat ? "
2920," Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs . "
2921, Do you eat a lot of vegetables ? 
2922," Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit . "
2923, What do you drink ? 
2924," Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you . "
2925, What do you drink ? 
2926,Where can I call a taxi ? 
2927," There's a taxi rank over there , right outside the gate . "
2928,How did your company's fundraiser go ? 
2929," The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research . "
2930, So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ? 
2931," Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars . "
2932, Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society . 
2933," In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause . "
2934,How may I help you today ? 
2935, I need to open a second account . 
2936, What kind of account would you like to open ? 
2937, I need another savings account . 
2938, Do you have another account with us ? 
2939, I sure do . 
2940, Would you like to transfer money from that account into your new one ? 
2941, That ’ s fine . 
2942, How much would you like to transfer ? 
2943, Transfer $ 100 . 
2944, Give me a moment while I complete your transaction . 
2945, That ’ s fine . Thank you . 
2946,How about your grades of study ? 
2947, I have been doing quite well . As reach 90 % and Bs reach 100 % . And I ’ Ve received Scholarship two times . 
2948," Besides your major , do you know some in other fields ? "
2949," Yes . To develop my knowledge , I studied Economics , Business Administration and Accountingthrough self-study . Nowadays , I have passed three courses on CPA . "
2950, Have you ever been a student cadre ? 
2951, Yes . I used to be the monitor of my class . 
2952, Did it affect you much ? 
2953," It ’ s a very important experience for me . First , it improved my organizing ability , and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective . Second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who I like or dislike . "
2954," In your spare time , do you have any part time jobs ? "
2955," Yes , I used to work as an assistant lawyer for Tienda Law Office . "
2956,What kind of a car do you have ? 
2957, An old one . 
2958," I know it's old , but what make is it ? "
2959, It's a Chevrolet . Why do you ask ? You going into the car business ? 
2960," Nothing like that . My cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him , so he's going to sell it - cheap . It's practically new . "
2961, well I have been thinking about getting a newer car . I can't afford a brand new one . 
2962, Would you like to look at my cousin's car ? 
2963, Is it a four-door or a two-door ? 
2964, It's a coupe with a vinyl roof . 
2965, Does it have automatic transmission ? . 
2966," Yes , and it also has power steering , power brakes , and air conditioning . "
2967, I guess I might take a look at it . 
2968,What is my prime responsibility in daily work ? 
2969, Your main job is serving the clients and giving them what they want . 
2970, What other things do I need to know ? 
2971, You'd spend 30 % of your time on the computer . You may be bored with a job like that . 
2972, No problem . I am used to it . 
2973,Good afternoon . May I help you ? 
2974," Yes , I ’ m here to see Joanna Stevens . I have an appointment at four . "

2980,How about your interview ? 
2981, They turned me down . 
2982, Why ? You are so excellent . 
2983, I think the only reason is that I was too nervous during the interview and I couldn't express myself the way I wanted to . 
2984, What a shame ! You should have showed yourself to them ! 
2985, It doesn't matter . I'll try other companies . 
2986, I suggest you hunt for a job on the Internet . 
2987, On the Internet ? I've never heard of it . 
2988, It's very convenient and it has become popular recently . 
2989, Is that safe ? 
2990," Of course , if you log on some standard websites . "
2991, Thank you for your advice . I'll have a try . 
2992,We are here . 
2993, OK . How much is the fare ? 
2994, The total is 45 yuan .

3014," You just cut into line , in front of me and everyone else , that's what ! Go take your place back at the end of the line , like every - one else ! "
3015," Oh sure , lady , and fat chance I'd get a ticket before they're sold out . I'm staying right here , understand ? So be a nice lady and butt out ! "
3016, Just what gives you the right ... ? 
3017," Because I'm no sucker ; only suckers go to the end of the line . It's as simple as that , lady . "
3018," Well , you're no gentleman , either . "
3019," Okay , lady , just to show what a gentleman I really am , I'll let you go in front of me . Now , just buy your ticket and shut your trap , will you , lady ? "

3021," What was that you just said ? Last one ... ? Hey , they've closed the ticket window ! "

3076,Don't tell me you're pregnant again . 
3077, I'm afraid so . 
3078,What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ? 
3079, Sure . Why don ’ t you try it on ? The fitting room is over there . 
3080, It ’ s just the right size-a perfect fit ! Have you seen anything you like ? 
3081," I ’ m thinking about buying this sweater . I know it ’ s June now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter . "
3082," It looks too big for you , but I like the color and the material is good quality . Is it on sale ? "
3083," Yes , it ’ s half price . It ’ s supposed to be too large--that ’ s the fashion . "
3084," I might get one too , but in a different color . I prefer light blue to white 。 "
3085," There.It looks great , don ’ t you think ? I ’ m going to get these jeans as well . I need a new pair . I ‘ m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter . "
3086," I ’ m getting this beret ? Doesn ’ t it look cool ? I ’ d like to get some jeans too , but I don ’ t have enough cash on me . "
3087, Don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve got my credit card . You can pay me back later . 
3088, Thanks ! Now I don ’ t need to come back to the shop a second time . 
3089,Good morning . Wilson Association . 
3090," This is Mr Brown speaking . I'd like to speak to Mr . Thomas , please . "
3091," I'm sorry , but Mr.Thomas left the office a few minutes ago . "
3092," That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy . Will he be back soon ? "
3093, I'm afraid not . He's gone for the rest of the day . 
3094, Is there anywhere I can reach him ? 
3095, I don't believe so . He's going out of town on business . May I take a message ? 
3096," I have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , but I'm afraid I can't make it . "
3097, Would you care to make another appointment ? 
3098," Unfortunately , I'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and I may be gone for several days . "
3099, I see . I can tell Mr.Thomas that you phoned . 
3100, Thank you . 
3101, Bye-bye . 
3102,I see you have bought the latest copy of “ beauty and fashion ” . Are there any interesting articles in it ? 
3103, There ’ s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . I enjoyed reading her thought . The “ which ? ” section is very interesting this month . They tested facial cleaners . The article recommends “ all clear ” for effectiveness and price . 
3104, I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine . 
3105, Which tests do you mean ? 
3106, You know . Tests like ” how jealous are you ? ” and “ are you a fashion victim ? ” 
3107," Oh , I see . I like to do those tests , too , but I don ’ t take them seriously . "
3108," Of course not , but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do . According to the jealousy test , I ’ m quite a jealous type of person . Perhaps I need to control my jealousy . "
3109,"Marry Wang's Office , this is Marry . "
3110," Hi Marry , this is Tom . "
3111, How can I help you ? 
3112, I need to see if we can get together today .

3114, Do we need to put on the jackets too ? 
3115," You ’ d better , to protect your clothes . Now please watch your step . "
3116, Thank you . Is the production line fully automated ? 
3117," Well , not fully automated . "
3118, I see . How do you control the quality ? 
3119, All products have to go through five checks in the whole manufacturing process . 
3120, What ’ s the monthly output ? 
3121," One thousand units per month now . But we ’ ll be making 1,200 units beginning with October . "
3122, What ’ s your usual percentage of rejects ? 
3123, About 2 % in normal operations . 
3124, That ’ s wonderful . Is that where the finished products come off ? 
3125, Yes . Shall we take a break now ? 
3126,Excuse me . May I take you a picture ? 
3127, With pleasure . 
3128, Thanks you . Shall we stand a bit further ? I would like to take the tower in . 
3129, No problem . 
3130, That's OK . If you want the photo I will mail it to you . 
3131," No need , sir . "
3132,Hello . This is the Directory Assistance . Can I help you ? 
3133, Can you give me the number for Jessica Hanson on locks Ave ? 
3134, I ’ m sorry . There is no listing under that name . Are you sure of the name ? 
3135," Yes , I ’ m pretty sure . "
3136, Do you have her address ? 
3137," Yes , I do . It ’ s 109 Locks Ave , L8V 4N9 . "
3138," That ’ s an unlisted number . I ’ m sorry , but I can ’ t give it to you . "
3139, I see . Thanks anyway . 
3140, No problem . 
3141,I ’ d like to open a savings account . Can you tell me how to do it ? 
3142," Ok , you have to fill out the form . And I let me see three identification cards or documents . "
3143," I have the driver ’ s license , a membership card and my passport . Would we do ? "
3144, Let me see them . Yes . There ’ re ok .

3151," I believe your corporation will try your best and I understand fully your feeling , if your tender conditions proved be suitable for our general conditions of tender , we will accept your submission of tender . "

3154," Fine , thanks a lot . Bye ! "
3155, Bye ! 
3156,"Good morning , Mr Zhang , I wonder whether you have got an answer from your superior . "
3157," Yes , we had a meting about it yesterday afternoon . "
3158, What's the answer ? 
3159," We decided that we could agree to your price , but we are a bit worried about the slow delivery . "
3160," Let me see . I quoted your delivery in three months , didn't I ? "
3161," Yes , but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible . "
3162," I thought you would be worried about it . So I rang Auckland last night . As you are our biggest customer , they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave Auckland next month . "
3163," Good , if you agree we'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then . "
3164, By all means . 
3165,Be careful . The floor is wet . 
3166, What happened ? 
3167, I spilled my drink . 
3168,"Hello , this is Lucie Jing calling from Lincoln Bank . May I speak to Mr Was , please ? "
3169, Speaking . 
3170," Ah , hello , Mr Was . I'm just calling about your new credit card . It has arrived with us , so you can either come to collect it , or we can send it on to you . "
3171, Sending it won't be necessary . I'm actually coming in for a meeting with my Personal Banker this afternoon . 
3172, What perfect timing ! 
3173, Indeed . Is there anything I need to do before I collect it ? 
3174," Not really . But we do recommend you to read through our terms and conditions again before you sign the card , just in case there is something you aren't happy with . "
3175, I'm sure it'll be fine . How about my PIN number ? 
3176," That will be sent on to you within 2 working days . Then , you can start using your new card . "
3177, Great . I'll be in later today . Thanks for calling . Bye . 
3178,What are we eating for lunch ? 
3179, I have no idea . What about you ? 
3180, I kind of want pizza . 
3181, I ate pizza the other day . 
3182," So , what do you feel like eating then ? "
3183, How about some burgers ? 
3184, I already had a burger yesterday . 
3185, What are we going to do ? 
3186, We can just each get what we want to get . 
3187, That sounds like a plan . 
3188, Do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ? 
3189, I think they sell both at the cafeteria . 
3190,Did you bring your certificate for nursing ? 
3191," Yes , here is my Certificate of Nurse . "
3192, How about your nursing education ? 
3193, I learnt nursing through theory and practice for 3 years at Hunan Nursing School . 
3194, Can you manage English conversation ? 
3195," Yes , pretty well . I have started learning English since primary school . "
3196,"Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ? "
3197," My husband and I have thought about it , but we've decided not to have any . They're just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of Worl "
3198," Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ? "
3199," For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share . "
3200, Don't you think you would miss having other people around ? 
3201," No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy "
3202," If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ? "
3203," That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like "
3204, Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ? 
3205," I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children ! "
3206,"Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses ! "
3207," I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine . "
3208," Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing . "
3209," So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ? "
3210," Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick . "
3211, Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ? 
3212," No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes . "
3213, You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned . 
3214,Is Tom in ? 
3215," No , he is at work now . "
3216, May I have his office phone number please ? 
3217," Sure . It's 289,1234 . "
3218,What about driving to Shanghai ? 
3219," Driving ? No way , it's too far . "
3220, I just thought it would be an interesting way to see lots of places . How long will it take ? 
3221," Too long , and you do not have much time . "
3222, What a pity . 
3223,Good afternoon . I'll show you to your room . 
3224, Thank you . 
3225, Could you tell me which bags are yours ? 
3226, They're over there next to the door . Those three with green tags on them . 
3227," Could you wait a moment ? I have to get a trolley . May I see your room key , please ? "
3228," Sure , here it is . "
3229," Thank you . Room 402 . You're on the 4th floor . This way , please . "
3230,"Excuse me , sir . Is there anything I can do for you ? "
3231," Yes . I bought the can two days ago , but today I found that is beyond the guarantee period . "
3232," Let me see . I am sorry , sir . We will change another one for you . Please wait a moment . "
3233,"Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ? "
3234, The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street . 
3235, How long will it take me to get there ? 
3236, It's about a ten-minute walk . 
3237, That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you . 
3238, Not at all . 
3239,Excuse me ! Does this bus go to the railway station ? 
3240," No , You're got on the wrong bus . You can take a No . 22 bus at the University station and then transfer to a No . 83 bus at the railway station . "
3241, OK ! Thank you very much ! 
3242,I have here our price sheet on a F . O . B . basis . The prices are given without engagement . 
3243," Good , if you ’ ll excuse me , I ’ ll go over the sheet right now . "
3244, Take your time . 
3245, I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high . 
3246, I ’ m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years . 
3247," We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ? "
3248," Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly . "
3249, The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ’ s settle that matter first . 
3250," Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent . "
3251," When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent . "
3252, How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ? 
3253," To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help . "
3254, Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ? 
3255, I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ? 
3256," Very well , I will . "
3257,"Excuse me , you look lost.Can I help you ? "
3258," Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station . "
3259, Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right . 
3260," Right ? OK , got it . "
3261, Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ? 
3262, Next left then right ? OK . 
3263,"I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said . "
3264," I said , ' Do you want me to help you ? ' "
3265, I'm trying to find a post office . 
3266, Go three blocks and turn right . It's right there . 
3267, Should I take the bus ? 
3268, No . It'll only take about five minutes to walk . 
3269, Thank you very much . 
3270, Anytime . 
3271,It says here that you graduated from Beijing Normal University with a major in English Language and Literature . 
3272, Right . Then you may think that I am not fit for this job according to my educational background . 
3273, Yes . 
3274, But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate . 
3275, So you must be an extravert ? 
3276," Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them . "
3277, What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ? 
3278," A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment . "
3279, Don't you consider it a hard work ? 
3280," Hard but interesting , I think . "
3281, Have you any experience as a tourist guide ? 
3282," Yes , I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University . "
3283, Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English ? 
3284," Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well . "
3285,"Didn ’ t you punch in this morning , Monica ? "
3286," Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching . "
3287, That ’ s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule . 
3288, Do we also need to punch out after work ? 
3289," According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day . "
3290," How about the lunch break , Lucy ? "
3291, From 11 thirty to 1 o ’ clock . 
3292, May I ask whether we need to work overtime ? 
3293," Sometimes , but not quite often . "
3294,This needs dry-cleaning.Can you remove this stain without harming the fabric ? 
3295," Let me see . We ’ ll try , but I ’ m not sure that we can remove it . "
3296," Ok , then . We ’ ll I ’ d also like to have this pressed . "
3297, Any starch ? 
3298, No starch . 
3299,What's the problem ? 
3300, I have a laceration on my left forearm . 
3301, Let me have a look . How did this happen ? 
3302, I got hit by a car in an accident . 
3303, Was there much bleeding afterward ? 
3304," No , not much . "
3305," Well , this doesn't look too serious . Nurse , could you please get me a suture set ? "
3306, Will I need stitches ? 
3307," Yes . Three , I think . It wont ' be too painful . Alright , we're done . That wasn't so bad , was it ? "
3308," No , not really . "
3309, You're lucky there was no lasting damage . I'll set up an appointment for you to come back in five days . We'll take those stitches out then . So long . 
3310," Thank you , doctor . Bye . "
3311,What time is it ? 
3312, Ten to nine . 
3313, Your watch is ten minutes slow . So it's should be nine sharp . I'm gonna be late again . What will be my excuse this time ? It should be set the alarm for seven thirty . 
3314," Don't cry over spilled milk , Fred ? Could you stay with me a few minutes ? "
3315, What ? Why ? What's wrong with you ? 
3316, I just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking.It ' s so lonely and boring . My sickness makes it worse . When will I recover ? 
3317," You will be fine in the couple of month , just be patient . I've got to woke now , I'll be late . "
3318, You only care about your work . 
3319," Sorry , baby , you are everything to me . all I do just for our family . "
3320," Stay just a few minutes longer , OK ? "
3321," OK , I'll leave at 9:15 , Is that all right ? "
3322, Yes . 
3323," I'll spent more time with you in the future , Dina . "
3324, Thank you . 
3325,Canton Hotel . 
3326," I'd like to reserve a double room . I will be arriving next Monday , the 12th . My name is Wilson . "
3327, A double room for the 12th ? The name is Wilson ? 
3328," Yes , that's right . "
3329, How long will you be staying ? 
3330," Three or four days , perhaps longer . "
3331," Very good , sir . We will be expecting you next Monday , the 12th . "
3332,How is the result of your lab test ? 
3333," When it comes to that , I have a lot to say . "
3334, Then say it . 
3335," When I went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests , I tried to keep a poker face even though I was scared to death . Then you guess what he said . "
3336, That ’ s just what I want to know . 
3337, He told me the tests were negative and there was nothing wrong with me . 
3338,Could you tell me something about your family ? 
3339," OK . There are five people in my family , Father , mother , elder brother , younger sister and I . "
3340, Are your brother and sister still in school ? 
3341, My brother has found his job and my sister is still in college .

3343, My father is a middle school teacher . 
3344, What about your mother ?

3350, Have you finished school ? 
3351," Yes , I have already graduated . "
3352,I'm in heaven ! A Whirlpool dryer ! 
3353," I love them , too . Let's move into the kitchen . Wait until you see the refrigerator . "
3354, This is too good to be true . 
3355," And the stove is brand new . You know how to use a gas stove , right ? "
3356," Yes . We've lived in Taiwan for a while . I had a gas stove in the States , too . "
3357," It's better for cooking Chinese food . Well , what do you think ? "
3358, We love it . But we'd like to know about the neighbors . 
3359,How's your new car ? 
3360, Perfect ! Couldn't be better . 
3361," You made a good choice , then ? "
3362, It's just what I want . 
3363, No regrets ? 
3364, I am really pleased with it . 
3365, I am glad you are happy . 
3366, It's super . 
3367,"Good afternoon , Sir . You're here to see about a Temporary Loan , right ? The loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets . Is that what you require ? "
3368," Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ? "
3369," Well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period . "
3370, Is there any flexibility on that ? 
3371," Unfortunately , not . "
3372," OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan . "
3373," Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away . "
3374,"Mr . Wang , I've had scheduled for your two days stay in Shanghai . You can make some changes if it does not suit you . "
3375, All right . Please read it to me . 
3376," On Friday morning , Mr . Wang , the director of Shanghai Research Institute , will visit you at the hotel . In the afternoon , you will discuss some problems with Mr . Yang , vice manager of computer corporation . "
3377, Very good . 
3378," On Saturday , you'll leave the hotel for sightseeing . Miss Lu will be your guide . "
3379," Oh , that's great . "
3380,"Hi , I would like to return this TV . "
3381," Sure , do you have the receipt ? "
3382, Yeah here you go . Actually I also want to return this keyboard . 
3383, Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ? 
3384, The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear . 
3385," I see , and what about the keyboard ? "
3386, I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work . 
3387," I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages . "
3388, Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways . 
3389,There are so many people that the tickets are all sold out ! 
3390, Luckily we got the last two . 
3391," Look , Danny . The Four Great Inventions ! "
3392," Gunpowder , compass , the paper making , and the printing . "
3393, I really admire those who made such great inventions ! 
3394," May , I don't see why they are great . They are just simple things . "
3395, They look simple today . But they were milestones in their times . 
3396," Milestones ? May , you must be kidding . "
3397," Just think Bill Gates , those inventions are as important as the windows system . "
3398," Well , I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them . "
3399," No , quite the contrary . "
3400, Why ? Didn't you say that they were milestones ? 
3401," Yes , but they went to the public without any patent protection . "
3402," Well , their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates . "
3403,What can I do for you ? 
3404, I need some medicine . 
3405, For whom ? 
3406, My wife . She suffers from a bad cold . 
3407, What symptoms does she have ? 
3408, Fever and a bad cough . 
3409," I see . Don't worry , just a common cold . "
3410, What kind of medicine does she need ? 
3411, Patulin will be enough . 
3412, How many pills for each time ? 
3413," Nine pills per day , and three pills after each meal . "
3414, Thank you very much . 
3415, It's my pleasure . 
3416,Do you believe in god ? 
3417, Not at all . I ’ m an agnostic . do you ? 
3418, I ’ m not sure . Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ? 
3419, I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one . 
3420," I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet . "
3421, I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong . 
3422, For example ? 
3423," Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics . "
3424, Yes . Such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs . 
3425,Didn't you say your friend was American ? Where is she going on her honeymoon ? 
3426, They're going skiing in Colorado . 
3427, What a coincidence ! These pajamas would be perfect to take along on the honeymoon ! 
3428," You're probably right . Oh , what the heck ! I'll take it all ... in maroon , like you said . "
3429,What a terrible house ! 
3430," I'm sick of it , too . "
3431," The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart . "
3432," It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out . "
3433, Sure . 
3434,Hello ! 
3435, Is that Sue ? 
3436, Speaking . 
3437, A.This is George . 
3438," Hello , George.What ' s up ? "
3439,This website offers very convenient air tickets booking service . It is quick and accurate . 
3440," Yes , I once booked there . They give the immediate confirm information and flight information to both your mobile phone and e-mail . You can conveniently pay by credit card , so the whole transaction only takes a couple of minutes . They also provide e-tickets , meaning you don ’ t need to go to any office to pick an air ticket . You go to the airport directly and check in with your ID card . "
3441, So it has attracted more and more customers these days . 
3442," Yes , therefore they are expanding the scope of their service . For example , hotels can be booked through the same site as well . "
3443,Excuse me . 
3444," Hello sir , may I help you ? "
3445, Yes . Can I see that T-shirt on the top shelf please ? 
3446, Sure . Here it is . 
3447, How much does it cost ? 
3448, 50 dollars . 
3449, 50 dollars . That's too much . 
3450, How about this one ? It's on sale for only 35 dollars . 
3451, I don't like that one . 
3452, How about the one next to the black gloves ? It's very similar to the one you like . 
3453, That's nice . How much is it ? 
3454, 30 dollars . 
3455, That'll be fine . 
3456," Is this color OK , or would you like a different color ? "
3457, That blue one's fine . 
3458, Do you need any more of these shirts ? 
3459, Yes . 
3460, How many do you want ? 
3461," I'll take two more , a red one and a white one . "
3462,"Hello , this is Li Bo speaking . "
3463," Hi , I am Liu Ming . I am calling to tell you that I have got the job . "
3464," Oh , that is wonderful . Congratulations ! "
3465, I really feel grateful to you for your reference . They have mentioned this in the job interview . 
3466, Don't mention it . I think that is because you have right qualifications and nice personality . 
3467, Thanks again . I will start on next Monday . I am sure I will have good performance . 
3468, I agree . 
3469,"I am a student in Cambridge University . I read your ad , I want to know something more about your room , please ? "
3470," It's a big bedroom with a drawing room , facing a beautiful wood . "
3471, Is there a bathroom ? 
3472," No , but there is one downstairs , which my daughter used some years ago . "
3473, It sounds good . Could I go and see it myself ? 
3474," Certainly , you're welcome anytime . "
3475, See you later ! 
3476," ( after a while ) Good afternoon , Mrs . Smith . I called you just now . "
3477," Welcome ! Come in , please ! "
3478, Yes . 
3479, This way please . Your room is upstairs ... Here it is . 
3480," Wonderful ! A modest , comfortable room . Ah , a beautiful window , through which I can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . How nice ! "
3481," Yes , if you want to wash something , there is a separate lavatory room outside . "
3482, Excellent ! I like it ! When can I move in ? 
3483, Anytime you like . 
3484, OK . 
3485,"Hello , this is Dunlin . May I speak to Mrs Smith ? "
3486, This is Mrs Smith . Can I help you ? 
3487, I am calling to say thank you for the interview yesterday . 
3488, You are welcome . I am very impressed by your capability . 
3489, Is there anything I should do ? 
3490," No , nothing . It's thoughtful of you to call me again . "
3491, Thank you . Please call me at any time if you have any questions . 
3492," Ok , I will . Do you have any question ? "
3493," No , thank you . Goodbye . "
3494, Goodbye . 
3495,Hi there . Welcome to Lincoln Corporate Services . How can we help ? 
3496, Hi . I was wondering what kind of fixed asset loans you have ? Do you have Fixed Asset Loans ? 
3497," Yes , we do . You'll go through the acceptance application , then a first review , then an evaluation and examination and finally get approval . Why don't you read through this brochure ? It outlines all of the important aspects of the loan , the terms and conditions , etc . "
3498," That's a good idea , to familiarise myself with it . Then , I'll be back if we decide to go ahead . "
3499,"There are many art craft items in this shop . I suggest you take your time , and you might find something you like . "
3500, That's what I am going to do . 
3501," If you have any problem , please come to me . "
3502, I surely will . How much is this wood carving ? 
3503, You are an expert on it . That wood carving is very rare . But I'm so sorry . that is not for sell . 
3504, That's OK . Is anything else recommended ? 
3505, Do you have any special request ? 
3506, I'd like to see some traditional arts . 
3507, So that means you are shopping for presents ? 
3508," Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends . "
3509," Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle . "
3510, Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut . 
3511," I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best . "
3512, You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale . 
3513," As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country . "
3514," Wow , you are the expert on it . "
3515,Operator . Can I help you ? 
3516," I'd like to make a person-to-person call to Beijing , China . The number is 2135367 8 , and I want to speak to Mr . Zhang . "
3517, To Mr . Zhang in at 2135-3678 ? 
3518," Yes , that's right . "
3519, May I have your name and telephone number ? 
3520," My name is Luo Gang , and the phone number is 513-3284 . "
3521," Mr . Luo , will you hold the line , please - - - Mr . Luo , there is no Zhang at that number . Will you check the number again , please ? "
3522," What the number I gave you , operator ? "
3523, It's 2135-3678 . 
3524," Oh , I'm sorry . should have been 2135-3668 , not 3678 . I've given you a wrong number . "
3525, Are you sure this time ? 
3526, Yes . 
3527, OK . Let me try again . 
3528, Thank you . 
3529,Are there any special requirements on the project ? And shall we talk around it in details ? 
3530," Yes , there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it . Besides , you see , in recent years , we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness . "
3531, That's a good idea . We can improve our technology to meet your special need . 
3532, And please let white color dominate . 
3533, OK ! I've noted it down . And any others ? 
3534, Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city . 
3535, I'll tell them . 
3536," Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor . "
3537, Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery . 
3538, Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you . 
3539, I think so . Bye ! 
3540, Bye ! 
3541,"Mr . Black , I ' d like to take some time off . I ' Ve been feeling exhausted these days . "
3542," That's no problem . Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ? "
3543, Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off . 
3544, That's long leave . How's your project coming along ? 
3545, The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on . 
3546," Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave . "
3547," Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients . "
3548, Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed . 
3549," I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black . "
3550,Did you ever get a parking ticket ? 
3551, Only a few . 
3552, What's a few ? 
3553," I've gotten six , I think . "
3554, Did you pay your fines ? 
3555, Of course I have . 
3556, How much are the parking tickets ? 
3557, I think they're $ 130 . 
3558, That's expensive . 
3559, I just got a parking ticket . 
3560, You should probably pay the fine soon . 
3561, I'm going to pay it today . 
3562,"Are you doing anything right now , Diana ? "
3563," I am typing a report for the moment , Mr . Robbins . Anything I need to do ? "
3564, Will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter ? 
3565, Is it urgent ? 
3566," Yes , this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5 . It's about a contract . "
3567," Ok , I am coming . "
3568," Please take a seat , Diana . Have you got your spare pens and pencils ? "
3569," Yes , I have this time . But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ? "
3570," No , I ’ d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter . "
3571, All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments . 
3572," Of course , Diana . You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it . "
3573," Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ? "
3574," Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list . "
3575, You want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ? 
3576," Right . And the last thing , we are going to clean the files out tomorrow . Now let's begin . "
3577,You're finally here ! What took so long ? 
3578, I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection . 
3579, It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home . 
3580," I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest . "
3581, perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work . 
3582, I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good . 
3583," It would be better for the environment , too . "
3584, I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city . 
3585, Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well . 
3586, The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car . 
3587," Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides . "
3588, That's true . I could certainly use the exercise ! 
3589," So , are you going to quit driving to work then ? "
3590," Yes , it's not good for me or for the environment . "
3591,"That's really convenient . We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though . "
3592, I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand . 
3593, That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out . 
3594," Sure , for at least three thousand per month . "
3595, That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for . 
3596," I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent . "
3597,Hello . I sent out my laundry yesterday.Aren ' t they ready ? 
3598, They'll be ready by this afternoon . 
3599," Oh , no ! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning . "
3600, Is that right ? We're very sorry . 
3601," I thought it was "" the same day "" service.Anyway , please do hurry . "
3602, I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock . 
3603," Well , then , would you send it to Japan , please ? "
3604," Yes , we'll do so . "
3605,"Hello , welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ? "
3606, I want to effect payment under an L / C today . 
3607," No problem . OK ... just checking for you . Ah , I'm afraid there aren't enough funds in your account to cover this transaction . What you can do is buy some US dollars , using local currency and we can credit your account with that amount . "
3608, That seems alright . What's the exchange rate like today ? Good or bad ? 
3609," It's not too bad today , actually . 828.23 . "
3610,"How can I help you , sir ? "
3611, I am here to have a discussion on your company's investment issue . 
3612," Sorry , could you tell me your name ? "
3613, I am James Pond from FAM Company and I am here to discuss it with Nova . 
3614, Do you have an appointment ? 
3615," Yes , I did it yesterday . Our meeting should be 2 pm . "
3616, I guess she forgot your meeting . She is attending an important meeting in the company . Will you have a seat ? May I leave a memo for her ? 
3617, Thank you . 
3618, She will be back soon . 
3619,Excuse me . Would you please make a suit with this material ? 
3620, Sure . May I take your measurements ? 
3621," Please don't make it too tight . This is for autumn wear , so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath . "
3622," I see , sir . Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th , that's in a week's time ? "
3623," The 10th ? I'm sorry , but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th . Could you have the suit ready by the 8th , or at the latest , the 9th ? "
3624," Well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . But in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . How about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ? "
3625," That's fine , thank you . "
3626,Good morning everyone . Thank you for attending the meeting today . I'm sure you all have a copy of the agenda . So let's get started with the first issue . 
3627, We're here today to present to you the results of our marketing research regarding the consumer behavior . 
3628," I would like to begin by introducing our foreign guests to our stuff on your left ( right ) , we have Mr . Brown , who is Vice President of Sales . Next to him is Ms . Arts , Director of Marketing for the Atlas Company . In the back row is Dr . Barolo , who is visiting from Italy . Thank you all for coming . "
3629," I am glad to see everyone is here and on time . Let's get started ! Susan , toss out some of your ideas . "
3630,It seems that many boys are fighting there . 
3631, Break it up ! I will not permit fighting in this campus . 
3632,the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! 
3633, exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment . 
3634," on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . "
3635," as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health . "
3636," I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse "
3637, what is the greenhouse effect exactly ? 
3638, it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature . 
3639," I see , so it's similar to global warming ? "
3640," they're related to one another , yes . "
3641, I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live . 
3642," people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well . "
3643, people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations . 
3644," I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place . "
3645,Would you like some cookies ? I just made them . 
3646," Thank you . Yes , I would . "
3647," These are chocolate , and those are almond-flavored . "
3648, I guess I'll try a chocolate one first.Mmmm ... this is delicious.Are they hard to make ? 
3649," No , they're really quite easy . Wait a minute , I've got the recipe right here.See ... these are the ingredients , and then you just follow the directions . "
3650, That does look easy . I think I'll make some tonight . 
3651,Can I help you ? 
3652, I'd like to buy a ticket to Casablanca on flight US125 tomorrow . 
3653," Hold on , plese.It will take off at 14:00 tomorrow.The price is $ 110 . "
3654," Well , I want to stay under $ 100 . "
3655, I am sorry Sir . We won't give any discount in busy seasons.The price is the same . 
3656,"How do you use an ATM card , Billy ? "
3657, It ’ s easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers . 
3658, Oh yes . I ’ Ve got it written down here . Just a minute . 
3659, You really shouldn ’ t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like . 
3660," Ok , I ’ Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don ’ t I ? "
3661," Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want . "
3662," I can just enter the amount using the key , right ? "
3663, That ’ s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money . 
3664," These machines aren ’ t very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk . "
3665,"Hello , is Jennifer in ? "
3666," I am sorry , you have the wrong number . "
3667," Oh , I am really sorry . "
3668,Can you give me a hand with the dishes ? 
3669, Sure . Should I wash or dry ? 
3670, I wash and you'll dry . 
3671, OK . Let's do it . 
3672,"Excuse me , do you have the latest issue of Newsworld ? "
3673," Yes , this week's issue just came in . Here it is . "
3674, How about Music Madness ? 
3675," Let me check ... yes , we got the October issue a few days ago . It's on that shelf over there . "
3676," Okay , I'll take these two magazines and a copy of Today's Post . "
3677,"Good afternoon , Miss . What can I do for you ? "
3678, Could you tell me my account balance ? My account number is ... 
3679," Just a moment , please . Your name ? "
3680, Emily Smith . 
3681, Here is your balance . 
3682, Thank you . I want to make a withdrawal of 150 dollars . 
3683," Here you go , Miss . "
3684, Thank you . 
3685,We will go to Luoyang for a vacation next month . 
3686, How long will you stay there ? 
3687, About one week . 
3688, Where will you live during the vacation . 
3689, In the hotel . 
3690, Have you made a reservation ? 
3691," Yes , we have . "
3692, That's OK . 
3693,You look great ! How do you stay in such good shape ? 
3694," Well , I go jogging every morning , eat a healthful diet and work out in a gymnasium twice a week . "
3695," Wow , it sounds like a lot of work . I guess I'm too lazy to do all that . "
3696,Bob from accounting is on the line . Do you want to speak with him ? 
3697," Yes , I need to talk to him . "
3698, I'll put the call through then . 
3699, Thank you . 
3700,I want to send some money to Australia . Could you handle it for me ? 
3701," Yes , madam , how much would you like to remit ? "
3702," 2,000 AD $ . "
3703," Which would you like to remit , by mail or by cable ? "
3704, What is the difference between them ? 
3705," The cable will take less time for your account , in the meantime , the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one . "
3706," Well , I think the cable is better . "
3707," OK , please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary , your name and telephone . "
3708, All right . Here you are . 
3709, Everything is OK . The commission is 50 yuan . 
3710, Here you are . Thanks a lot . 
3711,"Kate , can we change the channel ? "
3712, Why ? 
3713," This channel has so many advertisements , and it doesn't have any good TV programs . "
3714, OK . You can change it . 
3715, What about this one ? Do you like this program ? 
3716," No , I think it is very boring . Can you change it to Channel Twelve , please ? "
3717," Yes . Oh , it's a talk show . "
3718," Yeah , it's very funny . Have you ever watched it before ? "
3719," No , I haven't . This is my first time to watch it . "
3720, I'm sure you will like it . 
3721,"Excuse me , is there any summer resort around the town ? "
3722," As far as I know , the nearest one is next to the Willdon . "
3723, It doesn't matter . I just want to have a relax and I don't care how far it is . Can you tell me how to get there ? 
3724," Yes , take the greyhound bus . It will lead you directly there . "
3725, Thanks a billion . 
3726,"Every honored guests , welcome to Hang Thou . Now we are visiting Tiger-running Spring . "
3727," How can we relate tiger to this spot , Miss Zhang ? "
3728," Its name originates from a legend that two tigers run here and made a hole , and then a spring gushed out from it . "
3729, How ignorant I am ! 
3730, The Longing Tea and the Tiger-running Spring water are always considered as the “ Two Wonders in West Lake . ” 
3731, I know that tea . It smells fragrant . 
3732," That's right . All my guests , attention please . We will have half an hour to visit the spring and take photos . And next spot will be the Moon Reflected in Three Pools . "
3733," Janice , David , come here . We take some photos here . I can't imagine how beautiful it is ! "
3734,Can I give you a hand ? 
3735, Thanks . 
3736,You have been staying at home for several days . Would you like to hang out with me ? 
3737, No problem . Wait a moment . 
3738,May I speak to Mr . Baker ? 
3739, I ’ m afraid he's not in . 
3740, Will you ask him to call me collect when he ’ s back ? 
3741," Certainly . May I ask who ’ s calling , please ? "
3742," Yes , this is Cindy Wang of A & B Trading Company in New York . "
3743,"I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too title . "
3744," I'm not sure I can't agree , dan "
3745, Why not ?

3865,Can you tell me what's included in your warranty ? 
3866, Certainly . The product has a two-year guarantee . If it breaks down during that period we offer a replacement unit completely free of charge . Our products are very reliable but we recommend you take out an extended warranty . This covers you for a further two years .

3870," Our engineers are on call 24 hours a day . We guarantee someone will be with you within four hours , but in practice it's often much sooner . "
3871, Are there any exclusions ? 
3872, Not really . It's a very comprehensive warranty . I ’ ll put a copy in the post to you and you can read through the small print .

3883, I always have the temptation to eat something there . 
3884," Then , why didn't you do that ? "
3885, I don't know how much we can trust them . Do you have any ideas ? 
3886," Some of them , I think , are not good . "
3887, It doesn't taste good ? 
3888," No , I mean some of them are not clean enough . "
3889, That's my greatest concern . But how can you tell which one is clean ? 
3890, I judge by appearances . 
3891, I got it . I think it's worth trying . 
3892, It certainly is . 
3893," I'd like to try some kebab , roasted squid , and many different appealing things . "
3894," Don't try everything at one time , please . "
3895, I see . Thank you . 
3896,I need my minibar restocked . 
3897," Everything is gone , sir ? "
3898, There's not a drop left of anything . 
3899, Is there anything in particular you want ? 
3900," Yes , the Perrier and the Jim Beam hit the spot . Let me have three more of each . "

3907," I don't think you can . In China , our currency is not freely convertible yet . "
3908, Do you mean there is no way to get any foreign money ? 
3909," No . You can go to the Bank of China to exchange some US dollars at the current exchange rate of the day you exchange them . The maximum amount you can exchange is $ 2,000 . "
3910," Only $ 2,000 ? Are there any other ways to get the money exchanged ? "
3911, The only official way is to go to Bank of China . 
3912, I'd better take more dollars with me . It seems that I need to borrow some from my friends . 
3913,can you squeeze me in sometime today ? 
3914," That ’ s a big order , Jane . I am really swamped . "
3915," I know what you ’ re saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy . "
3916," Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? It won ’ t take more than a half hour , will it ? "
3917,You seem to be upset . What ’ s eating you ? 
3918, It ’ s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves 
3919, Dick ? How come ? He used to be as meek as a lamb . 
3920," Yes , he used to be . But now he ’ s drifting off track . "
3921," He must have been in bad company , or he wouldn ’ t be off the beans . "
3922,"Bring me some toast , please . "
3923, Would you like butter or jam on your toast or do you just want it plain ? 
3924," Spread some jam , please . "
3925, Anything to drink ? 
3926, Black coffee is fine .

3937," no , just occasionally "
3938," oh , i like this music very much , let's tango . "
3939, i'm afraid i can't dance well . 
3940,"Well , it's illegal to bring food and drinks into the theater . "
3941, Too bad . I did anyway . 
3942, No wonder you brought such a big bag today . 
3943, I brought Strawberry Sticks . See ? 
3944, Those are the ones that are pre-dipped in sweet coating ! 
3945, Yep . And there's real strawberry chunks in the coating . 
3946,I think that you look very cute today .

3948, What store did you get it from ?

3977, You will . 
3978, Oh ...

3995," Unless it ’ s marked differently , it ’ s their home numbers . "
3996, Alright . What if I can ’ t get a hold of them by phone ? 
3997," Then , you should e-mail them with the information . "
3998, Where can I find their e-mail addresses ? 
3999, They should have then listed on their resumes . 
4000, And if there aren ’ t any e-mail addresses ? 
4001, Then send them a SMS on their cell phone . 
4002, Ok . That sounds easy enough . Have you called any of them yet ? 
4003," Yes . I called the first three people on the list , but they didn ’ t pick up . "
4004, Did you leave a voice message ? 
4005, I left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list . 
4006, I see . What did you tell her ? 
4007, I told her that she should call me back at my office number . 
4008," Ok , so , maybe I should call her again . "
4009," Yes , that sounds like a good idea . She might not get the other message in time . "

4039, Yes . This gap can be filled by export market research before exporting . 
4040, But the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers . 
4041, That's right . They do not appreciate its value and consider it to be a luxury . 
4042," Therefore , when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market , they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount . "

4082,Looks like dinner's ready .

4084,I'm done . Can I watch TV ? 
4085, Here's some water . Take these multi-vitamins and Tylenol .

4100," Well , the yearly interest rate is 5.49 % for 3 years . I'm sure you are qualified to apply for this loan . "
4101, What about the loan repayment ? 
4102," You may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank , for example , payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments . "
4103, Does that mean I should deposit sufficient money to my account prior to the monthly payment date so that you can directly deduct the repayment of the principal and interest ? 
4104, Exactly . You are permitted to effect and early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank . 
4105, That's very thoughtful of you . Thank you so much . 
4106, You're welcome . 
4107,You really need to look at some of the problems we are having with the apartment . 
4108, That apartment never had any problems before . Are you sure the problem isn ’ t you ?

4110, Where do you think you have problems ? 
4111," There is no hot water , the bedroom has a broken window , and there are rats in the kitchen . "
4112," You know , no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before . "
4113, You are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment . 
4114, I will fix these problems when I get around to it .

4116, You can ’ t do that ! It ’ s illegal ! 
4117,I can ’ t believe these skirts are so cheap . 
4118," I know and they are really nice , too . "
4119, I ’ ll have to get a couple in different colors . 
4120," Me , too . "
4121," Buy them now though , or they might not still be here tomorrow . "
4122," Good idea , especially at this price . "
4123,Taxi ! 
4124," Yes , sir . Where to ? "
4125," Wangfujing , please ! "
4126, All right . 
4127," Oh , I like the music on your radio . It's nice . "

4140," Certainly ! The first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet . Dogs are very demanding . You need to take them for walks and they love to play . Cats , on the other hand , are more independent . "

4143," Not really . By the way , I don ’ t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake . "
4144," We have those , but I only sell them to people I know well , for obvious reasons . How about a lizard ? I have some that are very brightly coloured , are not aggressive , and are easy to feed and look after . "
4145, That sounds ideal . Could you show me some ? 
4146," Sure . Come over here . As you can see , I have a wide selection of species . They can live together , if you want lizards of different kinds . Do you have a favourite colour ? "
4147, I like the red one . What do they eat ? 
4148," You can feed them on various things . They will eat small pieces of meat , but I ’ d recommend insects . You can get them from your garden , but remember that lizards eat a lot insects . I sell them here . "
4149, Thanks a lot . What I ’ ll do si find out more online and drop by next week . 
4150, That ’ s fine . You shouldn ’ t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet . 
4151,I'd like to make sure my plane reservation is in order .

4378, It happened this morning . 
4379, What was taken ? 
4380, My wallet and cell phone . 
4381, Did you get a good look at the person who robbed you ? 
4382, I sure did . 
4383, Would you able to pick him out of a line-up ? 
4384, That shouldn't be a problem . 
4385,"Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money . "
4386," Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ? "
4387," Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg . "
4388," I don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate . "
4389," But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity . "
4390," Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point . "
4391," Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . "
4392,"Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ? "
4393, Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff . 
4394, I see . And how about the working hours ? 
4395," Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times . "
4396," Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me . "
4397," Good , as long as you understand that . "
4398," And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ? "
4399," Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month . "
4400, That sounds ideal . 
4401,Smells good ! What ’ s for breakfast ? 
4402," Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast ! "
4403, Nice ! Brunch ! 
4404," Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes ! "
4405, Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ? 
4406," Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light . "
4407, Looks good ! I ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice . 
4408, Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ’ t forget the syrup ! 
4409,"Come on , fellows . Let's enjoy my wife's cooking ! "
4410," Em , it's delicious ! "
4411, Thank you ! My wife likes cooking very much . 
4412, You're lucky .

4417,Why did you apply for the position ? 
4418," I learned from your ad.That you will provide on-the-job training for new employees.This is just what I need , because I'm a recent college graduate . I have the necessary knowledge and skills but I lack experience . "
4419, What do you hope to become ? 
4420," I want to prove my true value in the electronic industry , and hopefully in the near future I would be promoted to a higher position . "

4442, When did you get your passport ? 
4443, I got it last week .

4459, You have nothing to worry about with her . 
4460,"Good afternoon , ladies . May I help you ? "
4461," Can we have two adjoining double rooms , sir ? "
4462," Have you made a reservation , ladies ? "
4463, I'm afraid not . 
4464," One moment , please . I have to check if there are rooms available . I'm sorry , ladies . We have only two double rooms available but they are on different floors . Would you mind that ? "
4465, We prefer on the same floor because we will probably chat late at night . 
4466, Then may I suggest a family suite ? We have just had a cancellation . 
4467, What is it like ? 
4468, It's a big room with a king-size double bed and two single beds . We could also add rollaways . 
4469, That's great ! How much is it ? 
4470, Two thousand hongkong dollars per night plus ten percent service charge and five percent government government tax . 
4471, That's fine . 
4472," But ladies , the room is not yet ready . There will be a delay of about half an hour . Perhaps you could fill in the registration form first , and then rest in our lobby for a while . We will let you know when the room is ready . "
4473," Alright , hanks . "
4474," Ladies , hotel policy requires one night's room charge as deposit . "

4484," Well , right now , we can't afford internet use in the rooms . But you can go to the web bar in our hotel . It's on the 12 floor . "
4485, Thank you . I think I will go there .

4487, This is he speaking . 
4488," Oh , how do you do , Mr.Zhang ? This is Mary speaking , I have a present for you from Wu of Beijing . "

4510, Is it very cold in winter ?

4512,It's your turn to go first . 
4513, I went first last time . 
4514," No , Mary went first last time . "
4515," Oh , Okay . "
4516,Excuse me . Could you please tell me how to get to the nearest cinema ?

4521, That's all right . Have a good day . 
4522,"Nice to meet you , sir . I come from New Times Clothes Company . We learnt that your exhibits on the Trade Fair in Shanghai this month were marvelous . Would you please quote the price ? "
4523," Before we discuss the price , may I ask you what kind of exhibits you are interested in ? "
4524, Your summer clothes for white-collar and men's jackets . 
4525, Can you give us a rough idea of the quantity you require ? It is generally known that the price varies according to the quantity . 
4526," That is to say , 10000 sets for the one of white-collar and 5000 for men's jackets . "
4527," In that case , our offer for the white-collar series is US $ 200 , and the other is US $ 300 per set . "

4543," Are their cards free , too ? "
4544," No , their cards are for sale . "
4545,So what do you think of my new dress ? 
4546," I think it ’ s great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I ’ Ve actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine ’ s for a while now , but I wasn ’ t sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment . "
4547," Um , ninety-five dollars ? "
4548," Yes , that ’ s the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ? "
4549, I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen ’ s Boutique . I didn ’ t know I could get it cheaper somewhere else . 
4550," Of course ! Everything at Helen ’ s is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn ’ t you shop around ? "
4551," I don ’ t know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive . "
4552,"Long time no see , George ! "
4553," Yes , a very long time . "
4554, What brings you here ? 
4555, I'm here on vacation . 
4556,"Hello , this is ABC Corporation . May I help you ? "
4557," Yes , I ’ m enquiring about your advertisement for a sales manager in today ’ s newspaper . Is this position still open ? "
4558," Yes , but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ? "
4559," Yes , I have a lot of previous experiences in sales . I worked in sales departments for two companies since I finished my university . "
4560, That sounds fine . Please give me your name and phone numbers . I ’ ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . It will most likely be in a couple of days . Is it all right for you ? 
4561," Yes , my name is Brian and my phone number is 5294870 . "

4566, Do you want to know where I bought mine ? 
4567, Where'd you get it from ? 
4568, I got it from IKEA .

4570, It cost me a couple thousand for the whole set . 
4571, Is the furniture sturdy ? 
4572, The furniture is built extremely well . 
4573, I don't mind paying a lot as long as the quality is good . 
4574," Well , trust me . The quality is fantastic . "
4575,Which one of them is Marys brother ? 
4576, The one with a very big nose . 
4577, I'd like to meet him.Will you introduce him to me ? 
4578, OK . 
4579,What should be put in my education background ? 
4580," You are expected to write the educational experience about your high school and college , even the time span . "
4581, What do you mean by ' job intentions ' ? 
4582," Job intentions refer to the kind of job you are eager to get , for example , accounting , marketing . "

4607, You ’ re welcome . 
4608,What do you think of the project ? 
4609, Very interesting . Thank you for bringing it to us . 
4610, Are you interested in making this investment ? 
4611," We haven't decided yet , we will let you know if we do . "
4612,"David , how is your interview ? "
4613, I was nervous at that time . What about you ? 
4614, Just fine . I tried to answer every question raised by HR carefully . I found some answering skills are useful . These questions are different from exams . 
4615, We can have a rest now after this tough interview . 
4616, Don't be rush . It is suggested to write a letter for the Personnel Department of Future Clothes Company . 
4617, Sounds like a good idea . And I think this can leave deep impression to HR . How can we write a suitable letter ? 
4618, Just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company . And you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you . 
4619, I am getting to know your meaning . 
4620,"Good morning , I made an appointment with Dr . Smith , but I have to change it . "
4621," When you made your appointment , what day did you choose ? "
4622, My appointment was on Wednesday . 
4623, At what time was that appointment ? 
4624, It was for 4 
4625, I can see the appointment that you had . What day do you need to change to ? 
4626, I want to change to next Tuesday . 
4627, What time would you prefer ? 
4628, I would prefer three o ’ clock in the afternoon . 
4629, I will put you down for that time . Thank you for calling to reschedule . 
4630,Can I help you ? 
4631," En , I am looking for a porter , do you know where I can find one ? "
4632, There are so many here.The men with red hats are the porters . 
4633, What's the charge ? 
4634," Well , it depends how many pieces of luggages you have . "
4635, Thank you . 
4636,Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? 
4637," Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers . "
4638," Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ? "
4639," Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion . "
4640, I didn ’ t pay attention to that . 
4641,Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ? 
4642," It's a difficult choice.The train is a little faster , but much more expensive . "
4643," We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams . "
4644, Buses are more cramps and you can't walk around . 
4645, That's true.But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus . 
4646, Really ? I think you see more traveling by train . 
4647, So which form of transport do you prefer to use ? 
4648," I prefer going by train , even though it costs more . "
4649," Ok , then we'll go by train . I'm sure we'll have a good journey.Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ? "
4650," The trains aren't usually full.We can get them on the day we travel.We should buy return tickets , because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles . "
4651, We should take a packed lunch on the journey.The food they sell on the trains is always expensive . 
4652,Did you hear about Lulu ? 
4653," No , what ? "
4654, She and Vic broke up and now she ’ s asked for a transfer . 
4655, Get out of here ! I didn ’ t even know they were dating ! 
4656, No one really did . They were very discreet and professional at the office . 
4657,Here's a model of our latest design . What do you think of it ? 
4658," Well , I'm not too happy about it . "
4659, What's wrong with it ? 
4660," Well , I'm afraid it's not at all what I wanted . You haven't really followed my instructions.It ' ll have to be done again . "
4661," Oh , dear ! "
4662,"Hello , this is the International Youth Hotel . How can I help you ? "
4663," oh , yes . I want to check whether you still have any vacancies . I need three single rooms for next Monday . "
4664," ok . There're vacancies . Since the peak season is coming , it's advisable to book soon . Would you like to make a reservation now ? "
4665," yes , please . Do you take credit cards ? "
4666," yes , we accept all major credit cards . "
4667, and how about Internet access ? 
4668, there's free Internet access in the lobby . 
4669, is it available in the rooms ? 
4670, Unfortunately not . 
4671, that's OK . Is breakfast included ? 
4672," yes , breakfast is included and parking is available . "
4673, fantastic . Thank you very much . 
4674, you're welcome . And we have 24 hour reception . Please don't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions . 
4675,"I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted . "
4676, You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard . 
4677," You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well . What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation . "
4678,"What sort of shopping is nearby , Mr . Taylor ? "
4679, Call me John . This is a great area of the city for shopping . There ’ s a grocery store just around the corner . 
4680, What about things other than food ? 
4681," Well , the Riverside Mall has 200 stores in it , including four major department stores . "
4682, Are there small shops near here as well ? 
4683," Yes , on 4th street , near the movie theater there are many specialty shops , including clothing boutiques . "
4684," Well , that sounds just wonderful . "
4685," Yes , it ’ s a really nice neighborhood . "
4686,"Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it . "
4687," Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know.Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more . "
4688, But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished . 
4689, But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely . 
4690," Well , only you liked it really , darling . "
4691," Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy . "
4692,"Hi , Bob , everything okay ? "
4693, More or less . There's just one thing bothering me . 
4694, Oh ? What's that ? 
4695," Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy . "
4696, What gift ? 
4697," It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it . "
4698, You refused the gift ? That's terrible . 
4699," I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way . "
4700, Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade . 
4701, That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page . 
4702,"I've been looking for a swimming pool , but I haven't found one yet . "
4703," We have no pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in our gym . "
4704, Swim stations ? Could you be a little more explicit ? 
4705," You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere ? Well , it's the same thing . "
4706," Gee , that's a great idea . Now , how much do I have to pay ? "
4707," The stations are absolutely free to guests , sir . "
4708," Great ! Now , when can I go down there and use the stations ? "
4709, The swim stations are open daily from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m . 
4710," Boy , oh boy ! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks . "
4711," Be warned , sir . At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded . "
4712,"Hi . Today , I am the interviewer for your visa application . "
4713, OK . Here is my application form and all the documents . 
4714, Can you tell me why do you want a visa to America ? 
4715, Because I want to have a view of the exotic landscapes to extend my views and understanding of the world . 
4716, OK . Do you plan to go to America all by yourself or with your family ? 
4717, Myself . 
4718, Have you finished all you preparation ? 
4719, Yes . Everything is ready . 
4720,"What a pity you are leaving so soon . I wish you could stay a few more days . Sir , can you deliver a speech for us ? "
4721," Dear friends . Here , I wish to say a word of thanks for holding this send-off party for me . Actually I didn't expect at all for this . I owe a lot to all of you here . It's been 5 days since I came to visit here . Time really flies . I feel grateful for your welcome and help in the five days . I will miss you while I am leaving . Let's keep in touch in any way . What's more , to the success of our face-to-face meeting , to the upcoming cooperation of our two companies , bottom up ! "
4722," Cheers ! And we are honored to have such an honored guest today . Mr . James , I hope we will meet somewhere in the near future . "
4723," Madam , we also welcome you to visit our company . I hope you can also bring your family there to have a look of our company . In this way , we will know each other better . "
4724, Definitely ! Thank you ! 
4725,I have been thinking of buying a house and would like to speak with you .

4728, How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need ? 
4729, We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home . 
4730, Do you need to be located in a particular school district ? 
4731," It doesn ’ t matter , as we do not have any children . "
4732," Is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ? "
4733," In a perfect world , we would like a home with a view of the lake . "
4734, Thank you for all of the information . I will help you find the perfect house for you .

4755, I'm ready now . I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn . 
4756, And would you like an appetizer before your meal ? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup . 
4757," I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad . "
4758, Can I get you anything to drink ?

4779," Congratulations , Bob ! That ’ s great news , what ’ s her name ? "
4780, We ’ Ve named her Alice after my wife ’ s grandmother . 
4781, That ’ s a pretty name . Give your wife my best ! 
4782,"Excuse me , can you tell me where is the taxi stand ? "
4783, You can find one at the end of the street . 
4784, Are there any signs there ? 
4785, No.but there are quite many cars . 
4786, Thank you . 
4787,Would Dr.Black be able to see me at 9:00 a . m . tomorrow ? 
4788," I'm sorry , but she won't have any openings until 11:00 , unless there's a cancellation . "
4789, Would 1 : OO p . m . be convenient ? 
4790," Yes , she's free then . "
4791,Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache . 
4792, You should go to the dentist . 
4793, I hate dentists . 
4794," Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist . "
4795, It always hurts . I hate going . 
4796," Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out . "
4797," O . K . , O . K . , I ’ ll go . "
4798, Good . You feel better after you do . 
4799,"Sally , you look so corporate ! What interview do you have today ? "
4800, Amalgamated Trading Company . It's Swiss . Don't you think working at a foreign company would be glamorous ? 
4801," Yeah , I guess so . I've never actually heard of this one , but ... "
4802," Well , it's small , but it's a young , dynamic , rapidly-growing company with a progressive , humanistic philosophy . "
4803," You didn't read their brochure or anything , did you ? "
4804," Four times . I'm totally prepared . Oh , no ! I forgot to take off my nail polish ! And I have to be there in 15 minutes ! That's it . I blew it . "
4805," Well , they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they don't care about nail polish ... uh ... even blue nail polish . Just keep your confidence up and you'll do great . "
4806, But the competition is fierce this year ... and it seems like I'm the only one left who hasn't found a job . 
4807," Not quite the only one . I really wanted that job at the magazine , but I still haven't heard from them . "
4808,I'm calling to tell you that the merchandise ordered last month has not arrived yet . 
4809," I'm sorry , hold on a moment . I'll check it out . But we have already shipped it to you last month . Would you like us to contact the express company to know what's going on ? "
4810, Please find out the reason as soon as possible . We are in bad need of it . 
4811," Ok , I am terribly sorry for the trouble you are getting into.We will contact you first thing , once we know the reason . "
4812,I really want to make something for dinner . 
4813, What are you going to cook ? 
4814, I haven't the slightest clue what I'm going to make . 
4815, A teriyaki bowl sounds nice . 
4816, I don't know how to make that . 
4817, All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef . 
4818," That sounds fairly simple , but how do I cook it ? "
4819, The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice . 
4820, What's next ? 
4821, Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it . 
4822, What's the next thing I need to do ? 
4823, Then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy . 
4824,How do I submit an expense report ? 
4825, You need all your receipts for reimbursement . 
4826, You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ? 
4827," Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I ’ ll get it signed for you . "
4828,Good morning ! 
4829, Can I speak to Miss Cooper please ? 
4830," Would you hold on a second , please ? Miss Cooper's extension is engaged . "
4831," Engaged . Oh , dear ! Could you tell her it's a long-distance call ? "
4832," I'm sorry , sir . I can't interrupt her . I'm sure she won't be very long . "
4833, How long do you think she'll be ? 
4834, I really can't say how long she'll be . 
4835," Can I leave a message , please ? "
4836," Yes , certainly . "
4837, Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ? 
4838," Yes , sir . I'll ring her on an inside line if you like . "
4839, Thank you very much . 
4840,"Excuse me , waiter , would you please bring us a nest ? A friend of mine will join us . "
4841, Wait a moment . Here you are . 
4842," By the way , we would like to order some dishes for my friend . "
4843, Sure . 
4844,"Can you help me out , Chuck ? "
4845," Sure . What's it , Yvonne ? "
4846," I want to put my desk over there , but it's too heavy for me to move . "
4847," Okay , you take one end and I'll take the other . "
4848,Good morning . Madam . What can I do for you today ? 
4849, Hello . I hope you can help me ; I'm a little worried about my new card . 
4850, What seems to be the problem ? 
4851," I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it . "
4852," Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ? "
4853," No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it ! "
4854," You said you received your card this morning , am I right ? "
4855," Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ? "
4856," Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons . "
4857," Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me . "
4858,Can you manage chopsticks ? 
4859, Why not ? See . 
4860, Good mastery . How do you like our Chinese food ? 
4861," Oh , great ! It's delicious . You see , I am already putting on weight . There is one thing I don't like however , MSG . "
4862, What's wrong with MSG ? It helps to bring out the taste of the food . 
4863, According to some studies it may cause cancer . 
4864," Oh , don't let that worry you . If that were true , China wouldn't have such a large population . "
4865, I just happen to have a question for you guys . Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables ? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated . 
4866, I don't know exactly . It's a tradition . Maybe it's for sanitary reasons . 
4867,"Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ? "
4868, It was a nightmare . 
4869, What ’ s up ? 
4870," Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . "
4871," Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? "
4872," Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout . "
4873, This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ? 
4874, I am still waiting for their call . 
4875," Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward . "
4876,"Do you have any seat preferences , sir ? "
4877," Yes , could you put me in the no-smoking section ? "
4878, Yes . Would you like a window seat ? 
4879," If one's available , please . But not over the wing . "
4880,morning . Rent-A-Car Agency . May I help you ? 
4881, Good morning . This is Paul Alexander calling from the Isis Advertising Firm . We need a car to the airport for Mr . Phillips . 
4882," Certainly , Mr . Alexander . When would Mr . Phillips like to leave ? "
4883," Let me check ... His flight ’ s at 2:30 p . m . , so he should leave no later than 12 noon . "
4884,I'm calling today about a bill that I never received . 
4885, Can you tell me which credit card it was for ? 
4886, It was for my Master Card . 
4887, You should've gotten that bill two weeks ago . 
4888, I haven't got it in the mail yet . 
4889, The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed . 
4890, What am I supposed to do about my bill then ? 
4891, Maybe you should call your post office . 
4892," But if it's their mistake , can I get an extension on my bill payment ? "
4893," Yes , but you will need to send us proof of their mistake . "
4894," Okay , thank you very much for your help . "
4895, Not a problem . Enjoy the rest of your day . 
4896,"Jenny , don't you think it's really charming ? "
4897, Yes . It's a feast of eyes to walking in the museum . 
4898, Let's take our time and enjoy the art and sprite of the famous museum . 
4899, What a shame that we can't take pictures . 
4900,"OK , Allen . It's your turn . Are you ready ? "
4901, I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ? 
4902, Come on ! In the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song ! 
4903," I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night . "
4904," Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him . He loves "" The King . "" "
4905, I'll put the song at the front of the list . 
4906,Here is the document you asked for this morning . 
4907," Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks . "
4908," You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later . "
4909," This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ? "
4910, The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place . 
4911, Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do . 
4912,"How are you doing , Jim ? "
4913," Fine , just fine.How about you ? "
4914, Not too bad . 
4915,"I think your presentation impressed the client , Daniel . You did a good job . "
4916," Thank you , Mr . Cooper . I hope we get the contract . "
4917,What's for lunch ? 
4918, Pork chops . 
4919,What happened to you ? 
4920, I think I caught a cold . 
4921, Do you have any symptoms ? 
4922, Runny nose and coughing . 
4923, Do you have a fever ? 
4924," I have just taken the temperature , I don't think so . "
4925, It's not serious . 
4926, Are you sure ? 
4927, Yes . 
4928, What should I do ? 
4929," You should drink more hot water , and do some exercise . "
4930,What kind of place shall we rent ? 
4931," It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up . "
4932, Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat . 
4933," Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area . "
4934," I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home . "
4935," Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us . "
4936," Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early . "
4937, How much do you think the rent will be ? 
4938, I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month . 
4939,I don't think we can meet the delivery date you suggest . It's too soon . 
4940," Well , is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of June ? "
4941, The earliest we can do is by the end of June . 
4942,Did you have any working experience during college ? 
4943," Yes , I did some part-time jobs such as English tutor , salesman , and model . "
4944, What did you learn from your part-time jobs ? 
4945," I learned to be patient , professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales . "
4946,Smells good ! What ’ s for breakfast ? 
4947," Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast ! "
4948, Nice ! Brunch ! 
4949," Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes ! "
4950, Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ? 
4951," Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light . "
4952, Looks good ! I ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice . 
4953, Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ’ t forget the syrup ! 
4954,Can you tell me if there is a flight to New York ? 
4955, Yes . Flight DB117 departs at 5:38 pm and arrives in New York at 6:00 am with a layover in Chicago . It also makes a refueling stop at Colombia . 
4956, So many stops ! Don't you have any direct flights ? 
4957," Sorry sir , it is the only flight wa have right now . "
4958,Hello.Hot water overflowed from the bathtub.Will you help me ? 
4959, Would you turn off the tap ? 
4960, I did it . 
4961, Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door ? 
4962, OK . I will . 
4963, I'll have our housekeeper come right away . 
4964, I'm sorry I was too tired to fall asleep . 
4965," When you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub . "
4966, Right.Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ? 
4967,Would you like some more coffee ? 
4968, No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill . 
4969, The waitress is bringing the bill right now . 
4970," This waitress has really been on top of things , hasn't she ? "
4971," Yes , this waitress did a great job . "
4972," OK , let's see what the damage is . The total for our meal is $ 36.00 . "
4973, What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ? 
4974," Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ? "
4975," Yes , 20 % would be perfect . "
4976, Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . The total will be $ 43.20 . 
4977," Yes , that was one fantastic meal ! "
4978, I agree . Maybe we can come back again next week . 
4979,It ’ s time for me to go now . 
4980, Would you like me to go with you ? 
4981, I ’ d rather you stayed in the office and did these things . 
4982, Do you want to type that letter ? 
4983, I ’ d rather you typed it . 
4984, Do you want to tell her ? 
4985, I ’ d rather you told her . 
4986,Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head . 
4987, What crime did I commit ? 
4988," You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs , so we are taking you into custody . We ’ Ve found some heroin in your house . You have the following rights while you are being interviewed . You have the right to remain silent . You don't have to make any statement against your will . You have the right to defense counsel . You have the right to request an investigation of evidence favorable to your case . Do you understand your rights ? "
4989, I am innocent . 
4990,Would you like to come by and play bridge ? 
4991," Well , let's see . Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time . "
4992," Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired . "
4993," Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies . "
4994," Oh , we always go to the movies . Can't we do something different ? "
4995," Well , do you have any suggestions ? "
4996, Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ? 
4997," It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things . "
4998," Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff . "
4999, OK . 
5000," Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ? "
5001,"Tom , it's time for you to go to bed . "
5002," Good night , mum . "
5003, Good night . 
5004,Operator . May I help you ? 
5005," Yes . How do I get an outside line , please ? "
5006," Just dial 0 , wait for the dial tone , and then dial the phone number you want to call . Or we can place a call for you , if you want . "
5007," No , thanks a lot . I'll try it myself . "
5008,What's our target audience for this campaign ? 
5009," This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two . "
5010, Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ? 
5011," Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here . "
5012," Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ? "
5013," Demographics say an average age of 28.7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year . "
5014,"John , I'd like to see you in my office for a minute . "
5015," Yes , sir , I'll be there in just a moment . "
5016," John , I have been watching you . I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed . You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . I just want to let you to know , after this month's performance reviews , I'm recommending you for promotion . "
5017," Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department . "
5018," Well , it's not going to be in our department . I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . There's supervisory spot opening up in financial . I'm turning your name in for it . "
5019," Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff . "
5020, You've earned it . 
5021,How can I help you today ? 
5022, I am returning something that I bought yesterday . 
5023, What would you like to return ? 
5024, I'm returning a cellphone . 
5025, Was there something wrong with it ? 
5026, It's defective . 
5027, What isn't working on it ? 
5028, It keeps turning off on it's own . 
5029," Alright , do you have the receipt ? "
5030, I have it right here . 
5031, I'm going to take care of this and refund your money . 
5032, Thanks for your help . 
5033,I miss grandma . I dreamed about her yesterday . 
5034," Dear , let ’ s drop the subject . "
5035,"Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? "
5036, Good morning . I'd like to cash this check . 
5037," Yes , sir . Can you show you identity ? "
5038, What about the driving license ? 
5039, Don't you have any other identification ? 
5040, I am sorry . I only have my driving license with me . 
5041, Ok . Would you please sign your name on the back of the check ? 
5042, Thank you . Here you are . 
5043, How do you want your money ? 
5044, Would you give me some in twenties and tens ? 
5045, All right . Please wait for a moment . 
5046,"Could you fill in this form , please ? "
5047, All right . 
5048, Have you got any identification ? 
5049," Yes , here's my ID card . "
5050,"Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! "
5051, What ? What did you buy ? 
5052, It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! 
5053, What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? 
5054," There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . "
5055, And ? 
5056, So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . 
5057, And it's a brick ? 
5058, Yes . 
5059, I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? 
5060," I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . "
5061, So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . 
5062," Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . "
5063, But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? 
5064, He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . 
5065," Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! "
5066," C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . "
5067, That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . 
5068," You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? "
5069,"Hello , Arthur . What seems to be the problem ? "
5070," Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ’ m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision . "
5071," Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK , then , cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you . "
5072," Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign . "
5073," Wow , Arthur ! You ’ re as blind as a bat ! "
5074," Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times . "
5075," Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription . "
5076, Thanks doc ! 
5077," Arthur , that ’ s the bathroom . "
5078,Would you like some more coffee ? 
5079, No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill . 
5080, Good luck finding the waitress ! 
5081, The service this evening has kind of sucked . Is that our server over there ? 
5082," I'll go get the check , since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way . "
5083, Good . I'll just stay here until you get back . 
5084, So the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner . 
5085, How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ? 
5086, I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service . 
5087," I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight . "
5088, I think that we should leave 10 % . 
5089, $ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip . 
5090,"I want to fly to Congo on Monday , the 17th . "
5091, Let me see what's available . 
5092," By the way , I'd prefer a night flight . "
5093, Africa Airline 551 leaves at 9:00 pm . 
5094, That's fine . I want to pay in cash . Here is the money . 
5095,How much was your watch ? 
5096, Take a guess . 
5097,"A guy in my office got the flu the other day . Today I seem to have come down with it , too . "
5098," Very likely . You have a slight fever . Do you have a headache , too ? "
5099," Yes . I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because I'll be on a business trip in two days . "
5100," Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery . "
5101, But I'm going on a business trip in two days ! 
5102," Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others . "
5103,Would you care for a drink ? 
5104," No , thanks . I'm fine . "
5105,Let's go practice your driving . 
5106," If that's what you want to do , then we can . "
5107, Did you buckle your seatbelt ? 
5108, I'm buckled up . What's next ? 
5109, You need to start the car now . 
5110, What do you want me to do ? 
5111, Go left .

5115," All right , try parking here . "
5116, Thanks . Let's go driving again tomorrow . 
5117,How may I help you ? 
5118, I ’ m making a deposit today . 
5119, Cash or check ? 
5120, I would like to deposit a check . 
5121, You need to sign the back . 
5122, Okay . Here you go . 
5123, Would you like cash back ? 
5124," Yes , I would . "
5125, How much ? 
5126, Let me get $ 150 back . 
5127, Here you go . 
5128, Thank you . Have a good one . 
5129,I'd like to extend my visa for another two years . 
5130, Are you on a tourist visa or a student visa ? 
5131, Student visa . 
5132, What is the reason for extension ? 
5133, I'll go into a practical training as soon as I receive my Master ’ s degree from the University of Pennsylvania early next month . 
5134, We ’ ll need a letter from your university and a financial statement from you . 
5135,Do you like the apartment ? 
5136, I absolutely love the apartment . 
5137, Everything is okay ? 
5138, I do have one problem with the apartment . 
5139, What ’ s the problem ? 
5140, I don ’ t like all those stains in the carpet . 
5141, We will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment . 
5142, I did not know that . 
5143," I assure you that we will , and if there are any more problems , feel free to tell me . "
5144, That was the only thing that I saw wrong with the apartment . 
5145, I ’ m glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice . 
5146, It ’ s absolutely incredible . I ’ ll take it . 
5147,"Come in , Arnold . Have a seat . "
5148, Good morning . 
5149, Would you like something to drink ? 
5150," No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk . "
5151," So , you're a serious coffee drinker . "
5152," Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted . "
5153," Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something.For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ? "
5154," No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker . "
5155," Well , what would you like to talk to me about ? "
5156, I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal . 
5157, I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it . 
5158, It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday . 
5159, Yes . 
5160," Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here . "
5161, What do you suggest ? 
5162," The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation . "
5163, You mean because people have to go across town to get here . 
5164, Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road . 
5165," That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them . "
5166, I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them . 
5167, I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that . 
5168," Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more . "
5169, Well . 
5170, I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that . 
5171, You mean you want to run the meetings ? 
5172," No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better . "
5173, Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks . 
5174," I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized . "
5175," I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works . "
5176, Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it . 
5177," I will call the managers.Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this "" new style . "" "
5178,Do you have a good English-Chinese dictionary ? 
5179, Sure . How about this one ? 
5180, Is this the latest edition ? 
5181, Yes . We have both the paperback and the hardcover . 
5182, What's the difference ? 
5183, The hardcover is more expensive . 
5184," Oh ! I see . I'll have the paperback , please . "
5185,"Oriental China Airlines . Good morning , may I help you ? "
5186, I would like the round-way ticket to Shanghai on December 10th .

5188, What's the departure time ? 
5189, 2:30 
5190," Well , the afternoon will be fine . "
5191, First class or economy ? 
5192, First class will be preferred . 
5193," Well , afternoon flight on December 10th to Shanghai . May I have your name , please ? "
5194," My name is Janice . Well , I book this ticket for Nova , the marketing manager of Pineapple Computer Company . Where can I get the flight ticket ? "
5195, You may take it up at the ticket office . That is located on International Street 150 . 
5196,Where are you feeling the pain ? 
5197, I can ’ t stand up ! My stomach is killing me ! 
5198, Can you put your hand where it hurts the most ? 
5199, It hurts smack in the middle of my gut ! 
5200, Did this just come on suddenly ? 
5201," I felt OK until an hour or so ago , and then I just doubled over . "
5202, Have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently ? 
5203," No , and I don ’ t usually get a lot of stomachaches . "
5204, We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is . 
5205, I think that that is the best way to figure out what is causing this . Thank you . 
5206,May I help you ? 
5207," Yes , I would like to exchange some money . "
5208, what currency would you like to trade in ? 
5209, I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars . Do you accept $ 100 bills ? 
5210," No problem , we can accept any denomination . How much would you like to exchange today ? "
5211," Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ? "
5212," It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7.45RMB.If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7.35.Will that be all right ? "
5213," I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow ! "
5214,"Has your son started school yet , Tom ? "
5215," Next week , it ’ s going to be quite a shock for him ! "
5216, He ’ ll get used to it . They always do . I still remember when my daughter started . Are you going with him on his first day ? 
5217, You bet . I wouldn ’ t miss it ! 
5218,"May I speak to Mr.Huang , please ? "
5219, I'm sorry . Mr.Huang is quite busy right now . Could I pass him the message ? 
5220," Well , you see , I won't be able to keep my 9 "
5221, Let me see . He's free from 3:00 to 4:30 tomorrow afternoon . Can you make it then ? 
5222," Yes , of course . Thank you very much . "
5223, You're quite welcome . Thank you for calling . Bye-byeB 
5224,"Dad , hurry ! The train is coming . Aha , I am a superman . "
5225," Don't rush , behave yourself please ! Let the people get off first . "
5226," Oh , we should . There are so many people . What if the train got full before we could get in ? "
5227," But , if we all pushed our way in , nobody could get off , and nobody could get in either . "
5228, How many stops are there to the Aidan station ? 
5229, There are four more stops . 
5230," Oh , my God ! "
5231," What's wrong ? You are like a little monkey , on pins and needles ! "
5232, Because I need to use the restroom . Is there a restroom on the train ? 
5233," No , not on the train , but in the station . "
5234, Why not ? You told me that subway is a kind of train . If it had no restroom . what kind of train would that be ? 
5235," Well , that is a question . You want to offer a suggestion ? "
5236," Oh , yeah , but not today . I am busy with praying the subway may get there as fast as possible . "
5237, I guess you'll never forget today . 
5238,This broth is wonderful . What's in it ? 
5239, Lamb and beef . It will get even tastier when we add the veggies ! 
5240, Hey ! Watch out ! You're using the same spoon for both broths ! 
5241, So ? 
5242, You're getting that hot stuff in my mild broth !

5289, Let's go to aisle 4 to pick up some pasta for tonight . 
5290, Great ! Pasta for dinner . 
5291, And let's get a loaf of bread at the bakery for breakfast . 
5292, Maybe we should get a shopping cart . 
5293, I'll put the shopping basket back . 
5294,Did you lock the doors ? 
5295, All except the back door . I left that open for Tim . He took the dog for a walk . 
5296," Well , I'm going on to bed . I'm beat . "
5297, Okay . I'm going to stay up a while . I've got to go over the household budget . We're a little overspent this month . 
5298, Please tell Tim to close the door to the basement . I don't want the dog down there tonight . 
5299, Okay . Good night . See you at breakfast . 
5300,"Well , I'm glad you're finally back . I was wondering what happened . "
5301, I feel kind of stupid . 
5302, Why ? 
5303, We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet . 
5304, You got lost . You're kidding ! 
5305, No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost . 
5306, You could have called . 
5307, I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were . 
5308, You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ? 
5309, Guess where we ended up . 
5310, I don't know . Where ? 
5311," When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield . "
5312, Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ? 
5313, I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here . 
5314, Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here . 
5315, I know it is . I don't know how it happened . 
5316," Hmm , maybe I do . "
5317, What ? 
5318, Maybe I have an idea how it happened . 
5319, How ? 
5320," You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road . "
5321," Oh , that's what you think , huh ? "
5322,Won't you have some of this ? 
5323," Yes , thanks . "
5324, It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue . 
5325, It's very good . How do you make it ? 
5326, I use a special dressing and homemade catsup . 
5327, This salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day . 
5328, I'm glad you like it . 
5329, You Americans usually have nutritious food . 
5330," Oh , but Chinese food is so delicious . I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food . Do you follow recipes ? "
5331, We use different spices but few people use recipes . They learn to cook by experience . 
5332, I always use a recipe but my grandmother never did . She was a great cook . She would make clam chowder and cornbread every Sunday night . 
5333,I like these shoes . 
5334, Do you realize that all these shoes are half off ? 
5335, Really ? 
5336," Yes , but the offer only lasts this week . "
5337,Do you have experience in advertising ? 
5338," Yes , I used to have a part-time job in advertising company . "
5339, What were you mean duties there ? 
5340, I mostly did advertising planning . 
5341, What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ? 
5342," I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market . "
5343, What was the most important thing you have learned at work ? 
5344," The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact in success . If I want to make in marking in advertising history , I can ’ t stop studying and creating . "
5345,"Dad , may I have a room of my own ? "
5346," Oh , honey , I'm so sorry , we don't have enough space for you to have your own room . "
5347," Dad , but I don't want to share a room with Peter . He snores every night . "
5348," Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ? "
5349, Alright . Maybe it's the only way to do it . 
5350,"Come in and sit down , Jack . Now , what's the trouble ? "
5351," I've got a terrible pain in my stomach , Doctor . "
5352, I see . When did it start ?

5356, Let's see . Yes . You ' Ve got quite a high temperature . 
5357," I've got an awful headache , too , and my throat hurts . "
5358, Hm ... I think you ' Ve got the flu . 
5359, Is it serious ? 
5360," No , not at all , but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine . "
5361, How often must I take it ? 
5362, Three times a day after meals . 
5363," Thank you , Doctor.Goodbye . "
5364,Our usual supplier has let us down and I ’ Ve been looking through your parts catalogue . I need fifty GT670s . How soon can you deliver ?

5366,"Why don ’ t you sit down and relax , darling ? "
5367, I don ’ t want to . 
5368," Well , come and talk to me then . "
5369, Certainly not . 
5370, May I turn on the radio then ? 
5371, Turn on the radio ? What for ? 
5372, So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . 
5373, Listen to some music ? And who ’ ll cook dinner ? Will you ? 
5374," Ok , I will . But let ’ s go to a disco after dinner . "
5375," To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate pop . "

5389,Can you develop the roll of film ? 
5390, Sure . 
5391, How long does it take ? 
5392, 6 hours . If you are in a hurry we can develop it in 3 hours . 
5393, There is no need . I will come back tomorrow . 
5394,"Good afternoon Miss , would you be interested in buying more life insurance ? You know , you can never get enough . "
5395, I think my husband has some . 
5396," Are you sure he ’ s purchased enough insurance for both of you ? If something terrible happened with your husband , and he doesn ’ t have sufficient insurance , my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you . "
5397," That ’ s true . If something happened to my husband , I might lose everything . Both of us have to work to keep our home , car , and our children ’ s education . I can ’ t afford that by myself . "
5398, Could we sit and look at the policy I mentioned and see if that ’ s something suitable for you and your husband ? 
5399, Certainly . 
5400,The buildings are really magnificent . 
5401," Yes , millions of travelers come here every year for the view of the buildings . "

5410, You ’ Ve been very helpful . 
5411, My pleasure . 
5412,"I want to open a saving account , sir.What ' s the proper procedure ? "
5413," First , you fill out the application form and then we'll issue you a passbook . "
5414, Is there any minimum for the first deposit ? 
5415," No , Even a dollar is all right.Here ' s your passbook , sir ; just sign your name on it . "
5416, What is the annual interest rate ? 
5417, It varies from time to time.At present it is 6 % . 
5418," By the way , can I open a checking account too ? "
5419, By all means.But you have to deposit enough money before you can write out your checks . 
5420,You look depressed . What's on your mind ? 
5421," Well , I had a blood test last week . The doctor said that I have high blood pressure and my blood is thick and sticky . I'm very worried . "
5422," Take it easy . When we last talked , you promised there would be more exercises in your life . But now you are putting on some weight . "
5423, I have to admit it's easier said than done . 
5424," Well , I think it's time for you to change your eating habits and develop a healthy lifestyle . Regular exercise will improve your health . "
5425," But you know I'm just not into exercises . And I wouldn't have time for exercises , either . "
5426, You can do some jogging . It's easy and it doesn't take much time . 
5427," Actually , my doctor said the same thing . "
5428,"Excuse me , sir , but you have to put your bags here before entering the market . "
5429, Oh . I am sorry . I was busy looking for some whisky.Can you tell me the exactly place where I can find any ? 
5430," Yes , it's on the third floor . "
5431,Here ' s my passport . I'm a visiting scholar . 
5432, Do you have anything to declare ? 
5433," No , these are all my personal effects . "
5434, What's in the bag ? Would you mind opening the bag ? 
5435, Not at all . I don't know what's dutiable . Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use ? 
5436, NO . You don't have to pay duty on personal belongings . 
5437, Thank you . 
5438,Do you work well under pressure ? 
5439," Working under pressure is exciting and challenging . I don ’ t mind working under pressure . I work well under that circumstance . People can , I can . "
5440, Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? 
5441," No , nothing in particular . "
5442, How soon can you begin working for us ? 
5443, I need about two to three weeks for necessary formalities . I will quit then transfer to your company . 
5444,What do you want ? 
5445, I think I have a piece of apple pie . 
5446, Do you want something to drink ? 
5447, Coffee would be fine . 
5448, OK . Sit down and I'll get it . 
5449,Our new production control program's going live on Monday . The old and the new programs will operate in tandem for four to six weeks . That should give us time to iron out any little problems . 
5450, Hope it all goes well . We're very busy at the moment and certainly don't want any problems at this time of year . 
5451," Yes , I realise that . We've spent a long time planning and preparing for the change-over . I'm confident we won't have any major problems . "
5452,Who broke my chair ? 
5453, It wasn't me . 
5454,"Can I help you , Madam ? "
5455, Could you tell me what Ants on the Tree is please ? 
5456," Certainly , Madam . It's a stir fried dish of minced pork with glass noodles . "
5457, Sounds nice . I'll have that please .

5468, Pardon ? 
5469, Du Tao . D-U for Du and T-A - 0 for Tao . 
5470," Yes , Mr . Du , when were you born ? "
5471," I was born on January 1st , 1988 . I ’ m 20 years old now . "
5472, Where do you live ? 
5473," I ’ m living at Room 222 , Building 18 , N . P . U . "
5474, Can you leave me your phone number ? 
5475," Gladly , 8962105 2 . "
5476,Good morning . May I help you ? 
5477," Yes . I'm looking for an apartment , I'd like two bedrooms . "
5478," All right . Have a seat , please . Let me ask you a few questions . First of all , may I have your name , please ? "
5479, My name's Donald Eakins . 
5480," How do you spell your last name , Mr.Eakins . "
5481, It's E-A-K-I-N-S . 
5482," E-A-K-I-N-S.First name , Donald . And what's your present address , Mr.Eakins ? "
5483, It's 1446 Pine Street . 
5484," 1446 Pine . That's in San Francisco , isn't it ? "
5485," Yes , it is . "
5486,Did you check before you left the shop ? 
5487," Yes , I did . But when I got home , my son put it on and we found the hole . "
5488, Really ? Let me have a look at it . Mm . OK . Let me change it for another one . 
5489, Thank you very much . 
5490,"I hate to do this , but I've got to cancel a reservation I made earlier this week . "
5491," All I need is your name , phone , and reservation date . "
5492, My name is Rudy Randolph . I'm at 818-555-1234 . The reservation was for April 9 . 
5493," Randolph , Rudy . Let me hit one button , sir , and now your reservation is cancelled . "
5494," Okay , thank you . I'll make another reservation as soon as I can . "
5495, It's been my pleasure to help you . 
5496,Did you go and buy your bus pass ? 
5497," No , I didn't . "
5498, When are you going to go get it ? 
5499, I'm not sure where they sell bus passes at . 
5500, Why didn't you just ask me ? 
5501, Where should I go ? 
5502, You can get one from student services . 
5503, I had no clue that I could get it there . 
5504, I already knew that . 
5505, Thanks for letting me know . 
5506, You're welcome . 
5507, I'm going to go and get it right now . 
5508,"Tomorrow is my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ? "
5509," Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ’ s dress code . "
5510," Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt . "
5511," Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean . "
5512,Excuse me . Will you please keep an eye on my suitcase ? I just want to make a phone call . 
5513," Certainly , but will it take long ? "
5514," No , I'll be right back . "
5515, OK . I'll look after it then . 
5516,Mike's Mechanics . Can I help you ? 
5517," Yes , how do I get to your shop from Chilin ? "
5518," Go straight up Zhongshan Road and you will see our sign on your right , after you pass the museum . "
5519, Thank you very much . 
5520,Don't take too much off . I'm trying to grow my hair longer . 
5521, How about two inches ? 
5522," That sounds perfect . Do you think I can get some highlights today , too ? I've always wanted red . "
5523," I think that will over-process your hair , you should wait at least two weeks . "
5524, All right . I'll just have the cut and perm today . 
5525," Great . My assistant will wash your hair , and then I'll be back to help you . "
5526, OK . 
5527,"Oh , damn . There ’ s another traffic jam on the highway . "
5528, How can there be a traffic jam on a 16 - lane highway every day ? 
5529," There are just too many people , and too many cars . "
5530, I wonder if there was an accident . 
5531," No , they just said it too many people were trying to get off at the Capitol exits . "
5532," Well , let ’ s put on some music . We ’ re going to be stuck in this for a while . "
5533," All right , what do you want to listen to ? "
5534, How about some Beatles ? 
5535," Yeah , all right . "
5536,Excuse me . Mr . Emory ? 
5537," Yes , Ms . Rodriguez ? How can I help you ? "
5538, I wanted to see if I could arrange a meeting with you to discuss recruitment . 
5539, Absolutely . I ’ Ve been wanting to meet with you about that . Let me just get my book . 
5540,Who ate the cookies that were sitting here ? 
5541," I did , Mom . "
5542, Shame on you . I was saving them for your brother . 
5543,"Hello . May I speak to Brian , please ? "
5544," Sorry , you have the wrong number . There ’ s no Brian here . "
5545, Is this 777-9345 ? 
5546," No , it ’ s 777-9344 ? "
5547," Oh , I ’ m so sorry . "
5548, That ’ s OK . 
5549,"Put all baggage on the conveyor belt . Walk through the detector age one at a time , please . "
5550," Excuse me , ma'ma . Could you walk back through the doorway again , please ? "
5551, What for ? 
5552," Airport security . Could you empty your pockets over here , please ? "
5553, Really ? I'm in a hurry . All right . 
5554," Ah , a set of keys . "
5555, I'm embarrassed ! I forgot completely about them . I'm terribly sorry . 
5556, That's all right . Enjoy your flight .

5559, I'm not feeling well . I think I'm having a cold . 
5560, Looks like it.You need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest . 
5561," Yeah , I will . "
5562,Come on . All of us are waiting for you . 
5563," Oh , sorry . Cross my fingers . "
5564,"Come on , Mary . We have to do the laundry . "
5565, Where are we going ? 
5566, Down to the basement . 
5567, Do you have a washer down there ? 
5568," Yes . We have a dryer , too . "
5569, That's so convenient . Where are the dirty clothes ? 
5570, They are in the basement already . 
5571, But I didn't see you carry them down . 
5572, Don't you know that we have a laundry chute in the house ? 
5573,"Hi , John . "
5574," Oh , hi , Mary , come on in . Any problem ? "
5575," Oh , no problem . "
5576," Great . I forgot to ask you , though . How long did you want the place ? "
5577, Six months . 
5578," Oh , well , that might be a problem . I usually only sign one year leases . "
5579," Well , one year would be fine , too . I ’ m not planning on leaving the area anytime soon . "
5580," Well , if it ’ s not a problem . Then here you go . "
5581, Just let me look at it quickly . 
5582, Of course . 
5583, Looks like a standard lease . 
5584," Yeah , and don ’ t worry about the security deposit . If everything ’ s all right when you move out , you ’ ll get it back . "
5585, O . K . Great . Just sign and date it here ? 
5586, Yes . Thanks . You can move your stuff in tomorrow . 
5587, Wonderful . 
5588,"Excuse me , could you tell me the bookshop ’ s address ? "
5589," Yes , the bookshop is just around the corner.Turn left and you ’ ll see the bookshop . "
5590," Thank you very much.By the way , is the hospital beside the bookshop . "
5591," Right , if you see the bookshop , you can see the hospital . "
5592, Thank you for your help . 
5593, Not at all . 
5594,Hello ! Is this Mr . Chang ? 
5595, Yes . Who is speaking ? 
5596," This is Kelly speaking . I am calling from London . How are you , Mr . Chang ? "
5597," Oh , Kelly , I couldn't recognize your voice . Well , I'm fine . "
5598," Mr . Chang , I just want to tell you that we are leaving London for Beijing by flight CP 645 on Saturday morning . Could you meet us at the airport , please ? "
5599," Excuse me , I couldn't quite hear you . This line is crossed . Can you speak louder , please ? "
5600, I will say it again ... Do you hear me now ? 
5601, Much better . I will definitely go to the airport to meet you . 
5602, Thank you very much . Goodbye . 
5603, Goodbye . 
5604,"Hello , Mr . Hammer . Jack Ross here . I'm calling to confirm our appointment on Monday at ten o'clock in your office . "
5605, Yes . Everything's all set . 
5606, I'd like to bring Mr . Huang and Ms . Sun with me . 
5607, We're supposed to be meeting alone . 
5608," I know , but I think they may add something valuable to the discussion . "
5609," Fine . But no one else , OK ? "
5610," Yes , Mr . Hammer . "
5611,How beautiful the flower is ! 
5612," Really , it's so beautiful . "

5615, Where it is ? 
5616, It's a private garden . 
5617,You look fresh recently . And .. what's your weight now ? 
5618, 110 pounds . 
5619, Really ? Congratulations ! That's really something beyond my imagination . How did you make it ? Did you keep on a diet ? 
5620," No , you know I can't bear eating less . "
5621, Then do the slim pills take effect on you ? 
5622, I've quit it already . I go to aerobics class everyday instead . 
5623, How's it going on ? 
5624, You see . I've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite . 
5625, I'd better exercise my body too . My limbs are rusty now . 
5626, I don't think so . You look full of energy every day . Time has stood still with you . 
5627, Thank you . 
5628,Ahhs ! I'm beat ! 
5629, What happened to you ? You look like you got hit by a tornado ! 
5630, I just got back from fighting the crowds . 
5631, You mean at the mall ? Was there a sale ? 
5632," Yeah . For five minutes , everything was half off . It was total chaos ... "
5633, Cool ! 
5634," Grabbing , pushing and shoving ... "
5635,Thank god you are open ! I have an emergency ! 
5636," Hello , Mr . Henderson what can I do for you ? "
5637, I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP ! 
5638," OK , I can have it ready by the end of the week . "
5639," No , you don ’ t understand , I need this tomorrow morning ! I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ’ s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! She ’ s gonna kill me ! "
5640," OK , I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon , but this suit is also very stained . I can ’ t guarantee we can remove it completely . "
5641, Fine ! Can you also iron and starch this shirt ? 
5642, Certainly . 
5643," Great ! This is our secret ! If you see my wife , say nothing to her about this ! "
5644,How often does the bus run ? 
5645, Every five minutes . 
5646," Oh , here comes a bus ! "
5647, It comes on the dot . 
5648,My warmest congratulations on your promotion ! 
5649, Thanks . It ’ s nothing special actually . 
5650, Don ’ t say that . It owes to your efforts and team spirit . 
5651," Oh , it was nothing . Anyone could have done it . I still have a lot to learn yet . "
5652, You are very modest . Best luck in your new position . 
5653, Thank you . I won ’ t let this promotion change me . 
5654,"Yes , emergency . There is a huge fire here . "
5655," Calm down , sir . What's your name and where are you now ? "
5656, My name is Jerry and we are on the intersection of West Road and East Road . 
5657," Sir , leave the house if the fire draws any closer to your house . Our men will be over in 5 minutes . "
5658,Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? 
5659, Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it . 
5660, Totally agree . What is your solution ? 
5661," Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy . "
5662, You seem to have a very relaxed outlook . 
5663, It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress . 
5664," But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses . "
5665," I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team . "
5666,"Excuse me , is this the parcel counter ? "
5667," Yes , what can I do for you ? "
5668," I'd like to send this parcel , please . "
5669," What's in it , please ? "
5670, Some books and newspapers . 
5671, OK . please fill in this form and label it . 
5672, Is it all right ? 
5673, Yeah . And would you like to mail it by air ? 
5674," No , I'd rather send it by sea . "
5675," Thirteen yuan , please . Here is the receipt and change . "
5676, Thank you . 
5677, You are welcome . 
5678,"But Ernie , we're still missing something . We need someone to play the music ! "
5679," Oh right ... you know , my friend Eric is a DJ . Maybe he would like to play with us . "
5680, Hmm ... does he have a good ear for hip hop music ? 
5681," Well , I don't know , but we can find out . We can talk to him and ask if he wants to join our group . "
5682,"Excuse me , is there any room available ? I want a single one . "
5683, Yes . When do you want it ? 
5684," Next Today . By the way , is there a closed circuit TV ? "
5685," Yes , sir . "
5686, What about laundry ? 
5687," Sorry , sir . You have to pay by yourself . "
5688,What time does the museum close ? Any idea ? 
5689," I'm not sure , but I think It's open until 4 o'clock . "
5690, What time is it now ? 
5691, It's a quarter past three . 
5692,I would like to buy some local handcrafts as gifts to my friends and relatives . 
5693," There are many stores selling handcrafts in Paris . Our store is wellknown for vase , table wear and jewelry boxes . You can take your time and choose whatever you like . "
5694," Well , the tapestry is delicate and beautiful . "
5695," You have made an excellent choice , it is our newcomer . The tapestry is on hot sell with the design and quality . The design on it is traditional Paris architecture . "
5696, How much is it ? 
5697, 100 frances . 
5698," Mmm , it is reasonable . Look at this set of table wear , it is so beautiful ! "
5699, We have a piece of table clothing to go with it . It is a brocade one with pretty stars . 
5700, This silver vase is a good ornament for the living room . 
5701, You are right . 
5702," I will take the tapestry , the set of table wear and the vase . "
5703, OK . Do you like these candles ? They are on sale now . 
5704, All right . I will take one . 
5705,It's so boring . 
5706, Don't you like it ? 
5707, I don't . Is there anything worth watching on the other channel ? 
5708, I think it's a basketball match on channel 5 . 
5709, Do you mind if we switch over ? 
5710," Well , I'd rather see a movie . "
5711, What's the movie ? 
5712, ' Star war ' . 
5713, It must be interesting . 
5714," Yes , you're right . "
5715,Where can I get my baggage ? 
5716, Are you from a domestic flight or an international one ? 
5717, An international one from Seattle . 
5718," In that case , you should go to the baggage hall over there . "
5719," Oh yes , I see the sign , thank you . "
5720,Man ! That car almost hit me ! 
5721," Yeah , that was close . "
5722,Excuse me . 
5723, Yes ? 
5724, Could you tell me where the copy room is ? 
5725, Sure . You just walk down this hallway . The copy room is the second room on the right . 
5726,"Doctor , save my baby , please "
5727, What symptoms does he have ? 
5728," He has had a fever for one day . Just now at home , he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up . We were at a loss what to do . We called an ambulance and brought the baby here . "
5729, How long did the convulsion last ? 
5730, About 3 minutes . 
5731, Does he have any other complaints ? 
5732," Three days ago , he began to cough , sneeze and have a running nose . Yesterday , he began to have a fever . "
5733, Have you taken his temperature ? 
5734, It was 38 ° C this morning and it was 39 ° C just now . 
5735, Let me examine him to see if there is any rash . No rash . 
5736, Is it serious ? Is it meningitis ? 
5737," No , it is not meningitis . Just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection . "
5738, Does he have to be admitted to hospital ? 
5739," No . No need for admission . I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . Then I will give you a prescription . The pink tablets are used for his fever . When his temperature is over 38 ° C , give him one tablet . The other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions . The white liquid is for the cold . Give the baby plenty of water to drink . "
5740," Thank you very much , doctor . "
5741,Jack ! Do you want to see a picture of my new puppy ? 
5742," Sure . I thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies , not new pets ! "
5743," Well , this is my new baby . He ’ s just as much trouble . That ’ s for sure ! But , he ’ s a lot of fun ! "
5744, I see what you mean . He ’ s really cute . How old is he ? 
5745,Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me ! I ’ Ve always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me ! Let ’ s get started ! 
5746," Ok , let ’ s start opening some presents ! "
5747," Oh look ! What a great little bib for the baby ! This will definitely come in handy ! Oh wow , you also got me a stroller ! That ’ s so great ! Thank you ! "
5748, This next one is from Betty . 
5749," A highchair and car seat ! Wow Betty , thank you so much ! I really appreciate it ! "
5750, One more from Carla . 
5751, A playpen and crib ! Thanks Carla ! This is just what I needed ! 
5752," OK , that ’ s all of them . No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ? "
5753, Umm . I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital ! 
5754,"Wow , this is amazing . I'm glad we've come here . So cool . "
5755," I always love skiing . You know , it's a cool game for cool people . Stay with me and you will be cool , too . "
5756," Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look . "
5757, Sure . It's probably the skiing show . Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors . 
5758, See that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that . 
5759," Hey , don't be so pathetic . It's a maximal sports show . What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show . "
5760, You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ? 
5761, They are all very experienced and great skiers . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim . 
5762," Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow in here ? "
5763, Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ? 
5764," Hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist . "
5765," Sorry . Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine . "
5766, Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ? 
5767, It's possible . But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can . 
5768," It's a good thing . OK , let's go skiing . "
5769, Here we go . 
5770,Would you like a smoking or non-smoking room ? 
5771," Non-smoking , please . "
5772,Good morning ! May I help you ? 
5773, Yes . My wife and I are interested in renting a house for the summer . 
5774, Do you want a furnished house or an unfurnished one ? 
5775, Furnished . 
5776, Very well . How long do you want the house ? All summer ? 
5777," No , not all summer . Just for six weeks . "
5778, I'm afraid I can only rent it for two months . 
5779," My holiday is only six weeks , but I think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks.Is the house in good condition ? "
5780," Yes , it is . It was just painted and it has all the modern conveniences . "

5786, That's good to hear . You've had an ideal recovery from your operation . We're going to send you home tomorrow . 
5787, Do you think I can get back to work very soon ? 
5788, Don't be in such a hurry . I'm confident that you'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks . 
5789, Is there anything I should do ? 
5790, You'd better have a good rest for a week . Be sure to have regular meals . Stay away from alcohol.Give up smoking at least a little while . 
5791, Should I take some medicine ? 
5792," Yes . I'm going to give you some.Take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . For that one , two tablets . And remember to come to the out patient department for a consultation in two weeks , please . "
5793, It's very kind of you . 
5794, You're welcome . We wish you a speedy recovery.Goodbye . 
5795,"Sir , would you like some dessert now ? "
5796, Please show me the menu again . 
5797," Here you are . sir , the chocolate cake is very delicious . "
5798," No , thanks . I don't like chocolate . I'd like strawberry pie . "
5799, I am afraid there is none . 
5800, Then I'll have vanilla ice cream . 
5801, Fine . I will bring it right away . 
5802,"Bruno Bistro , how may I help you ? "
5803," Yes , hello , I would like to make a reservation please . "

5855,Now people are talking about world recession which started more than a year ago . Can you give us your personal assessment of the situation of the global economy ? 
5856," As you know , we are in a very special time . This is a very hard time for many countries ' economics , both developed and developing . I think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies . "
5857, What is the direct impact of the terrorist attack upon your country's economy ? 
5858," Once the US economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack , the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world . "
5859, What challenges is your country's economy facing at the moment ? 
5860, We do face a lot of challenges because there is still much uncertainty about the world economy . It's very important for us to strike a proper balance between investment in fixed assets and household consumption . 
5861,"So , what do you plan to do today ? "
5862, There is a Matisse exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art . Larry and I will go .

5873," I suggest you go to the Jewish Museum.It ' s not far from the Guggenheim , near Central Park . It is really very interesting.Also , there is a great museum of medieval European art further up north.It ' s called the Cloisters . "
5874, How can we get up there ? 
5875, You can take a bus . 
5876, But Larry says the neighborhoods in the north are dangerous . 
5877,Finally we have a long holiday . 
5878," Yes , what about us having a tour ? "
5879, Good idea . Where shall we go ? 
5880, How about Milan ?

5914, Why don't you wash clothes at home ? 
5915," I would , if my washing machine wasn't broken . "
5916, Why don't you just get it fixed ?

5977, Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible . 
5978, Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .

5980, An understanding of the basic workings of a company and the services or goods it provides is essential . Do you have that ? 
5981," Sort of , but I could know more , I guess . "
5982," With that understanding , you can figure out what your company is looking for in terms of basic attitude . Right ? "
5983, I think that they are a very formal company . 
5984, What you wear is important . So keep in mind what is suitable for the company and type of work you will be doing . Need help ? 
5985, I need a lot of help in this area . 
5986," In addition to clothes we need to think about other basics , OK ? "

5998, That's good advice . 
5999, Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ? 
6000, Are there any seats available by the emergency exits ? 
6001," Let me see here ... yes , there's one left . "
6002, Ok . I'll take that one then . 
6003, Alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ? 
6004, I like to travel light so I just have this one . 
6005," If that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ? "
6006," Yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ? "
6007," You're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . Here's your boarding pass . Enjoy your flight ! "

6009," Well , we could probably get started with a strategy meeting tomorrow morning at 8 "

6011, That ’ s fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ? 
6012,I need a pan . 
6013, Okay . Do you have a particular size in mind ? 
6014," Well , the bigger the better , I think . "
6015, Look at this one . It's our biggest pan . 
6016," Yes , that is big enough , but it's too heavy for me . "
6017," Okay , we have the same thing in aluminum . "
6018," Oh , this is nice and light . But it has an aluminum handle . "
6019," Try this one . Same aluminum pan , but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle . "
6020," Oh , yes . This is very nice . I'll take this one . "
6021, That's a good choice . How do you want to pay for it ? 
6022," Cash . Oh , I almost forgot . I need a lid , too . "

6033, We'd like to visit the factory . Can you show me the way ? 
6034, That's OK ! We'll take you to have a tour . Please follow me . 
6035, How many shifts are there in your factory ?

6183," That , my dear , was classic sales technique delivered by a professional . "
6184, Are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit ? 
6185," Heck no , we doubled the price , but because it's you , I'll let you have'em at 50 off . "
6186, You silver-tongued devil . Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ? 
6187," I could , but where's the fun in that ? "
6188,Hi . I ’ m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delay.How long of a delay is expected ? 
6189," So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case . "
6190, Do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ? 
6191," I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ? "
6192, What seems to be the problem ? 
6193, It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry . 
6194, Umm ... You know ... Actually I was thinking of trying another airline . No need to hold my seat . 
6195,I need to go to the ATM . 
6196," So , why don ’ t you ? "
6197, I have no idea how to use the ATM . 
6198, What do you mean ? 
6199, This will be my first time using an ATM . 
6200, I can help you with that . 
6201, Explain to me how to use it . 
6202, Just put your card into the machine . 
6203, Now what do I do ? 
6204, Then you need to type in your PIN . 
6205, Now what ? 
6206," Just click on one of the choices they give you , and that ’ s it . "
6207,Would you like something to drink ? 
6208, Yes please . Do you have any teas ? 
6209, Of course we have lots of teas ? 
6210, What do you recommend ? 
6211, What about a green tea or perhaps a jasmine tea ? 
6212, What ’ s this one ? 
6213, That ’ s Oolong tea – it ’ s a Cantonese tea . 
6214," Ok , I ’ ll try that . "
6215,"May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ? "
6216," Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing ! "
6217, Why are they all in glass boxes ? 
6218, For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air . 
6219, So there isn't air in the glass boxes ? 
6220," No , there isn't . They are all vacuumed . "
6221," I wonder how old these things are , thousands of years ? "
6222," Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time . "
6223," Hey , look at the three-leg cup . I've seen it on TV . "
6224," The bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless ! "
6225," Yeah , it has no value at all . Who will use this cup today ? "
6226," Danny , priceless means so valuable that you can't put a price on it . "
6227," Oh , it does ? "
6228,I am so worried about this English contest . I have butterflies in my stomach now ! 
6229, I have confidence in you . Believe in yourself . 
6230,What would you like on your pizzas ? 
6231, We want one vegetarian supreme and one double pepperoni . 
6232," Would you like anything to drink with that ? For $ 1.50 , you can get a two-liter bottle of Coke . "
6233," No , thanks . "
6234, All right . That'll be $ 12.50 . Your pizzas will be there in 30 minutes . 
6235, Thanks . 
6236,We are redecorating and I'm going to add some things . 
6237," Well , I'll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office . "
6238, Shall we meet at 1:15 this Thursday ? We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . 
6239," Fine , I'll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday . "
6240,Can you tell me the way to library ? 
6241," Sure , turn left at the next crossing . "
6242, Is it on Xinhua street ? 
6243, Yes . You can't miss it . 
6244,"Comfort Inn , may I help you ? "
6245, I ’ m looking for a hotel near the convention center . 
6246, You ’ re in luck ! We ’ re just a two-minute drive from there . Would you like to make a reservation ? 
6247, Not just yet . I have one or two questions . How much for a single ? 
6248," During the peak season , a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night . But we ’ Ve got a Single Super Saver Special going on right now – only $ 30 a night . And we ’ Ve also extended our checkout time 00 in "
6249," That ’ s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients . "
6250," Yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . We can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . Of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking "
6251, That sounds great . Do you accept checks ? 
6252," I ’ m sorry , sir , we don ’ t . But we do accept all major credit cards . "
6253,"I am sorry to trouble you , but there's a lot of noise in the next room . "
6254," Oh , is there ? Which room is it ? "
6255," It's . I think , neighbours on the right . "
6256, You mean the room thirteen-thirteen ? 
6257," I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhausted , but I can't sleep . "
6258," All right , ma'am . I'll check and tell them to be quiet . "
6259," If next room is still noisy , could you give me a different room , please ? "
6260,Have you ever been to Xi ’ an ? 
6261," Yes , I ’ Ve been there several times on business trips . But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city . "
6262," I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place . "
6263, I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening . 
6264, Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ? 
6265," Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train . "
6266,"A ticket to London , please . "
6267, A cheap day return ticket ? 
6268," Yes , including London Tube . "
6269, That'll be twelve pounds . 
6270,"Doctor , what is the best way to stay healthy ? "
6271, Having a good diet is probably the most important thing . 
6272, It is very confusing to know what to eat . 
6273," You need plenty of fruits and vegetables , small amounts of protein , and whole grains . "
6274, Are there certain things that I should avoid ? 
6275," You shouldn ’ t consume too much sugar or caffeine . Also , watch your intake of fatty food . "
6276," After watching my diet , what else should I do ? "
6277," You need to stop smoking , and make sure that you get 30 minutes of exercise every day . "
6278, Can I have a glass of wine now and then ? 
6279," As long as you don ’ t overdo it , a glass of wine a day should be OK . "
6280,"Darling , I am back . What are you doing ? "
6281," I am washing clothes . Are you hungry now ? Wait for a moment , I'll cook dinner for you . ( Steven bends his brows ) "
6282," B , should we get a maid ? "
6283, I can do all the housework . We don't need a maid . 
6284," You have worked very hard in the office . If we can get someone to help you , you can have more rest . "
6285, We really don't need to . 
6286," You are a good wife , Julia . But you must take care of yourself . "
6287, Give me some time to think about it . 
6288,Can I reserve a room from the 13th to the 18th ? 
6289, Certainly . How do you like your room ? 
6290, I'd like a suite . What's the rate ? 
6291, $ 40 per night . 
6292,Is there anything I can do for you ? 
6293," Excuse me , can I change my order ? I am afraid I don't have so much time to enjoy my dinner . "
6294," I am sorry , sir . Your fish will be ready in five minutes so you can't change it . "
6295, That's all right . 
6296,Have you graduated now ? 
6297, Yes . I graduated this past June . 
6298, Which university did you graduate from ? 
6299, Guangzhou University . 
6300, What degree did you receive ? 
6301, I received a bachelor's degree in Economics . 
6302, What courses did you take in college ? 
6303," My major courses were Microeconomics , Macroeconomics , International Trade , International Finance , World Economy , Psychology and Business English "
6304, Why did you choose to study Economics ? 
6305, Because I was quite interested in Economics then . 
6306, Can you speak other languages except English ? 
6307, I can also speak a little Japanese . 
6308, I am very satisfied with your answers . 
6309, Thank you very much . 
6310,"Once you arrive at the American airport , please call me . "
6311," OK , don ’ t worry about it . I will . "
6312, Take care of yourself . 
6313,"Sorry , Mary , I can't make it in time for dinner . "
6314," Okay , Bob , when will I see you ? "
6315, Maybe I will be around later . 
6316," Okay , I'll see you later . "
6317,"I am sorry , sir . I have broken the reading lamp in my room . "
6318," Well , sir . May I have your room number ? "
6319, 503 . I would like to pay for it . 
6320, Please fill out the form first . 
6321," OK , can you bring me a new one ? "
6322, Of course . 
6323,Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription . 
6324, It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills . 
6325," Yes , I need to refill it today . "
6326," Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice . "
6327, I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not . 
6328," Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription . "
6329," Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ? "
6330," I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out . "
6331, But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription . 
6332," Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never . "
6333, But I have a prescription . I just need more of it . 
6334," A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you . "
6335," Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor . "
6336," Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry . "
6337," This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . "
6338, Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too . 
6339,What are you doing ? 
6340, I ’ m trying to put the vase on the shelf . 
6341, Let regive you a hand . 
6342," No , thank you . I can manage it , I think . "
6343,There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose . 
6344, Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers . 
6345, I'd rather get one with separated speakers.They give a clear sound . 
6346," Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture . "
6347, That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony . 
6348, Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration . 
6349,Ahhchooo ! 
6350, You've been sneezing a lot lately . Are you sick or something ? 
6351," No . Every spring time around April , I'm stricken with allergies . "
6352, I never have seasonal allergies . 
6353, Consider yourself lucky . 
6354, What are all the symptoms ? 
6355," Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water . "
6356, That doesn't sound good . 
6357," No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ? "
6358," Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family . "
6359, Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol . 
6360," I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body . "
6361, That's pretty bad . 
6362, But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah . 
6363,Let's have a look at the map first . 
6364, All right . Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here . 
6365, Let's buy some tickets . 
6366, The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train 
6367," Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ? "
6368," No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them . "
6369,What do you do ? 
6370," I'm an apprentice with a local engineering firm . My training lasts for two years . Two days a week I study Engineering at a local college . If I pass all my exams , I hope the company will take me on as an engineer . "
6371,"I want to keep a pet , but I don't know which one to buy ? "
6372," Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day . "
6373," Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then . "
6374, What about cats ? They are more independent . 
6375," Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat . "
6376, How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ? 
6377," Yeah , are they easy to look after ? "
6378," Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything . "
6379,Can I be of any service to you ? 
6380, I've been told that Chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship . We'd like to take some home . What would you recommend ? 
6381," There are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop.For example , there is tricolored pottery originating in the Tang Dynasty , embroidery , batik , jade carving , just to name a few.Do you have anything in mind ? "
6382," No , not really.But I think it should be something distinctively Chinese . And easy to carry . "
6383," I would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik.They are very easy to carry . "
6384," So , we'd like to see some embroidery . "
6385,"Hey , Mary . We're back . Have you eaten yet ? "
6386, I had some bread for breakfast . 
6387, Let's go out for brunch . 
6388, Brunch ? 
6389," It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also . "
6390," Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch . "
6391,"Hi , my name is Sovia.What ’ s your name ? "
6392, My name is Jeff . 
6393, What do you do ? 
6394, I ’ m a podiatrist . What about you ? 
6395, I ’ m a nurse.What do you do in your free time ? 
6396," I like to play piano , go bowling and chat with my friends.And you ? "
6397," I like to hang out with my friends , play games and go swimming . "
6398, Would you like to go out some time ? 
6399," Sure , that ’ d be great.Where would you like to go ? "
6400, Anywhere with you . 
6401, Aren ’ t you sweet . 
6402,"Oh , I'm starving . I'd like to try some real Chinese cuisine . What would you recommend , waiter ? "
6403," Well , it depends . You see , there are eight famous Chinese for instance , the Sichuan cuisine , and the Hunan cuisine . "
6404," They are both spicy hot , I've heard . "
6405," That's right . If you like hot dishes , you could try some . "
6406, They might be too hot for me . 
6407, Then there's the Cantonese cuisine and the Kiangsu cuisine . Most southerners like them . 
6408, What about any special Beijing dishes ? 
6409, There's the Beijing roast duck . 
6410," Oh , yes . I've heard a lot about it . I'd like very much to try it . Where can I find it ? "
6411," You can find it in most restaurants , but the best place is certainly Quanjude Restaurant . "
6412, Is it near here ? 
6413," Not too near but not too far either . A taxi will take you there in 15 minutes , If the traffic is not too bad , I mean . "
6414," Well , thank you for your information . But what is the name of that restaurant again ? "
6415, Let me write it down on this slip of paper for you . You can show it to the taxi-driver . 
6416, That's very kind of you . Thanks a lot . 
6417,"hi , Isaiah . How are you ? "
6418, I ’ m well . And you ? 
6419, fine . How ’ s your job going ? 
6420," I don ’ t know if I told you or not , but I decided to start my own business . "
6421, really ? That ’ s fantastic . What kind of business is it ? 
6422, I ’ Ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from Goldman Sachs . 
6423, how ’ s it going ? 
6424," it started off a bit slow , but now , business is really booming ! "
6425, that ’ s such great news . I ’ m really happy for you ! Where is your office located ? 
6426," our headoffice is here in Beijing , but we ’ re planning on opening up two more offices soon . "
6427, where will those be located ? 
6428," if all goes well , we ’ ll open one up in Hong Kong in April and another one in Singapore in October . "
6429, when will you find out ? 
6430, we ’ re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow . 
6431," well , good luck . I hope it all goes well for you tomorrow ! "
6432, thanks ! 
6433,"Ant Shirley , it's being years since we last met . How were you doing in the passing years ? "
6434, Pretty well . What about you ? 
6435, Fine . Where are the other guys ? 
6436, It's a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie . 
6437, Bad timing . I want to see them so much . How are they ? 
6438," Not bad . I heard you are going to graduate this coming summer , right ? "
6439," Yes , that's why I'm here . I'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment . "
6440, Did you go to a real estate agent ? 
6441," No , that will be too expensive . "
6442," That's true . By the way , what kind of apartment are you looking for ? "
6443, My first job's salary will be a bit low . So the cheaper the better . Just one I can afford . 
6444, Sure . I'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you . 
6445, I'll appreciate it so much . 
6446,Good afternoon . 
6447, My goodness ! It ’ s the afternoon ? Doesn ’ t the time fly ! Do come in and sit down . 
6448, Thank you . 
6449, What ’ s the time ? My watch has stopped . 
6450, It ’ s half past twelve . 
6451, When do you have lunch ? 
6452, From one to two . 
6453, What do you normally eat ? 
6454, We usually go to the cafeteria . 
6455," Oh , it ’ s time to have lunch now . "
6456, let ’ s go together . 
6457,"Merry Christmas , Bill . "
6458," Merry Christmas , Jina . "
6459, What are you doing there on the computer ? 
6460," Come have a look , I received many beautiful e-cards . They are from my friends , all over the world . Christmas wishes for all my friends . "
6461, That's pretty interesting . Did you get one from Haven ? The reason I ask is that I am looking for her number . 
6462," Sorry , I don't have it . But I do have her Email . You want me to sent it to you ? "
6463," Yeah , that would be great . Thanks . "
6464, No worries . I just for her card . And you can get her from Email . I would really like to talk to her again . I kind of miss her a little this days . 
6465, Thanks million . 
6466, My pleasure . 
6467,There are so many eating utensils on the table . Which ones do I use first ? 
6468, Use them from the outside in . 
6469, I see . A set for appetizers and another for the main course . 
6470, Right . We do the same thing at home . Don't you remember ? 
6471, Oh yeah . The big napkin goes on my lap . 
6472, Let's look at our menus . 
6473," Cindy , help me order because I'm still not very familiar with American cooking . "
6474," Well , we order appetizers first and then entrees . "
6475,It was nice talking to you . 
6476, Why are you trying to rush me off the phone ? 
6477, I really have to go . 
6478, Why ? I still wanted to talk to you . 
6479, I have things to do . 
6480, Like what ? 
6481, Don't be nosey . 
6482, I'm not . I just want to know . 
6483," Well , it's really none of your business . "
6484, That's harsh . 
6485," I'm sorry , but I have to go . "
6486, Fine . 
6487,"Mom , will you have time to help me with my homework today ? "
6488," Sorry , I won't . I'll be working against the clock to finish my presentation . "
6489,"Well , Peter , you have to do better than that next time , won ’ t you ? "
6490," Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ? "
6491," Of course , you have . You must try harder this time . "
6492, And must I go back to school ? 
6493," No , you needn ’ t do that . You ’ d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes . "
6494," But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ’ m nearly 17 . "
6495, You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study . 
6496, What else I ’ Ve got to do ? Join the army ? 
6497, Who knows ! That might come to later . 
6498,How do you do ? 
6499, How do you do ? 
6500," My name is Wang Liang , I ’ m from Beijing . Where do you come from ? "
6501, I come from the city of Tangshan in Hebes Province . 
6502," You're from Tangshan ? I can't believe my ears . I was also born in Tangshan , but I was brought up in Beijing . "
6503, Really ? It's nice to meet you . How long have you been with this company ? 
6504," Just over 4 years now . Since this is your first day here , I'm sure you don't really know too much yet . Let me show you around , so you can introduce yourself to everyone . "
6505," Oh , Thank you very much ! "
6506,"Hello , Parker . How's everything ? "
6507, Can't complain . And you ? 
6508, Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How's your schedule look ? 
6509, Let me see . I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday . 
6510, Great . 
6511,I like to open up a savings account please . 
6512, O . K . We offer a few different kinds . 
6513, I want the one with the highest interest rate . 
6514, That would be our Saver's Plus account . 
6515," 4.5 % , that's good . How much money do I have to keep in it to get that rate ? "
6516," You have to maintain a balance of $ 10,000 in the account or the rate drops to 3 % . "
6517, All right . I ’ ll open one of those . 
6518," Just fill out these forms , and I ’ ll be with you in one second . "
6519, Thanks . 
6520,"Hi , where can I find a cheap cashmere sweater ? "
6521, How about an outlet ? 
6522, Great idea ! 
6523, Outlets give good deals . 
6524, Thank you so much . 
6525, You're welcome . 
6526,I have difficulty with this form . Will you please explain it to me ? 
6527," Actually there is a sample over there . But if you still have a problem , let me know . "
6528," Oh , that's great . Thank you very much . "
6529,Do you develop films here ? 
6530," Yes , we shall . What size do you like ? "
6531," Well , the 4 x 6 is fine . "
6532," Which do you prefer , color or black and white ? "
6533," The last one is black and white , all the rest should need color . "
6534, OK . 
6535, I hope they will come out well . When should I pick them up ? 
6536," They will be ready at noon tomorrow . Each negative develops one print , right ? "
6537," Yes , it is . And develop them as glossy as possible . "
6538, No problem . Do you need another film ? 
6539," Yes , a roll of Kodak film please . "
6540, It is totally $ 20 including the deposit for films . 
6541,How come it is slow as a snail today ? 
6542, You mean the network connection ? 
6543," Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response for any click . "
6544, I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately . 
6545, Ok . 
6546,I need help . I think my arm is broken . 
6547, Alright . Have you been to this hospital before ? 
6548," No , I haven't . I need help quick . It hurts really badly . "
6549, I understand . It's good you came to the emergency room . 
6550, Let me see a doctor . 
6551," I'm sorry , sir . You will need to wait at least a short time.We are very busy tonight . There was a big car accident on Highway 106 . "
6552, I thought this was the emergency room . 
6553," It is . But unless you are critically injured , you still need to wait.You aren't bleeding , are you ? "
6554, No . Only a little . I fell off my porch . 
6555," Oh , that's terrible . Is it your right arm or your left arm ? "
6556, My left arm . 
6557, Can you fill out this form then ? 
6558," No , I can't . I'm left-handed . "
6559, That's very inconvenient for you then.You ' ll probably have a cast on your left arm . 
6560, Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room . 
6561," Yes , it is . But even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done.Have you ever been in an emergency room before ? "
6562, No . Just let me see a doctor . I'm worried about my arm . 
6563," Be brave , sir . It won't be long . I will fill out the form for you . What is your name ? "
6564, Steve Schliessman . S C H L I E S S M A N . 
6565, Alright Steve . Your social security number ? 
6566, 349-95- 8821 . 
6567, Do you have medical insurance ? 
6568," Yes , I do . Blue Cross . "
6569, Do you have your insurance card with you ? 
6570," No , I don't . "
6571," Well , you can call it in later . You can phone us . "
6572, Can I sit down now ? 
6573, First I need to get your address . Try to move your arm as little as possible . 
6574,Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice . 
6575," Yes , it is . Thanks . I ’ m just surfing on the internet . "
6576, Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ? 
6577," This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ’ m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee ! "
6578, That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ? 
6579, No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city . 
6580," So , what programs do you have on your laptop ? "
6581, I ’ Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs . 
6582," I know you are keen on photography . It ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at a "
6583," It ’ s wonderful , isn ’ t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I took recently ? "
6584,What shall we do today ? 
6585," We'd better stay in the hotel , because the tour will begin tomorrow . "
6586," Let's go out for some exercise , shall we ? "
6587, What an excellent idea ! 
6588, Shall we do some jogging ? 
6589, OK . 
6590, I feel well now . 
6591," Yes , some exercise is necessary for us . "
6592, Quite right . 
6593,I was wondering if you need any help on your new project . 
6594, Sure ! That would be great ! Are you good at writing or would you rather do the computer work ? 
6595, I would like to help with the computer work . 
6596, Great ! We are going to be working in teams of three . Are you OK working with others ? 
6597," Yes , I like working like that . "
6598, We will begin next Monday . Would you be available then ? 
6599," Yes , I can be there . "
6600," Well , if you could send me your basic background information before next Monday , it would be useful . "
6601," OK , I will send the information to you . "
6602," Well then , thanks for your help . Have a great day ! "
6603,"Congratulations , Francis . Your hard working finally pays off . I am so happy for your promotion . "
6604," Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it . "
6605," I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ? "
6606," Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful . "
6607, How do you think if I volunteer for some work ? 
6608, I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives . 
6609,Taxi ! 
6610," Yes , sir . Where to ? "
6611," The city square , please . "
6612, Are you in a hurry ? 
6613," Yes , I have to be there to meet a friend at 5 thirty pm . So we're sure we can get there on time ? "
6614," I'm afraid not , sir . Generally we can , but you know how it is in the rush hour now . "
6615, I see . Here's the extra 5 $ for you if you can get me there on time . 
6616, All right . I'll do my best . 
6617, Oh.we made it . Thank you . How much do I own you ? 
6618, The reading on the kilometer is 12 $ . 
6619," Here's the money , keep the changes , please . "
6620, Do you need a receipt ? 
6621," No , thank you . "
6622,"Janice , I can't find the document I was working on last month . Can you help me to look for it ? "
6623," Susan , I'm sorry . Did you look up those files I requested ? "
6624," Yes , but I still can not find it . Maybe it is in this cabinet . "
6625," I couldn't find the files you request , even though I checked all the cross-references . I don't think it's there . "
6626, I am sure that document was filed . 
6627," Well , let me check again under a different heading . "
6628, Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files . 
6629, Maybe that's why I couldn't find it . All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V ' . 
6630,What would you have ? 
6631, I'll try Chinese wine . 
6632," What about this dry red ? It's good indeed , it never goes to the head . "
6633," OK . Give me one , please . "
6634, Here it is . 
6635, Thank you . 
6636, I'm always at your service . 
6637,Are you planning on voting ? 
6638, Yes . Are you ? 
6639, I will be voting tomorrow . 
6640, What ’ s your polling place ? 
6641, My polling place is at the park up the street . 
6642," Oh , yeah ? "
6643," Yeah , where is yours ? "
6644, I don ’ t know . 
6645, How is it you don ’ t know ? 
6646, The location of my polling place never came in the mail . 
6647, You can always just check online . 
6648, Let me go do that . 
6649,"I am sorry , I have broken my wine glass , and would you please bring me another ? "
6650, Sure . I will clean the glasses for you . 
6651, Thank you . Where is the washing room ? 
6652, Walk straight and turn left . 
6653,"What's wrong , officer ? "
6654," You do realize that you ran a red light , don't you ? "
6655, I did ? 
6656, You didn't see the red light ? 
6657," I'm sorry for running it , but I really didn't know . "
6658, Didn't you learn that red means stop ? 
6659, I know that . 
6660, Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light . 
6661, I'm not sure . 
6662, I'm giving you a ticket for this . 
6663, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding . 
6664, Maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light . 
6665,"Medicine Industry , this is Peter Bush speaking , can I help you ? "
6666," Good afternoon , could you connect this call with Mr Brown , please "
6667, May I know who's calling ? 
6668, This is Li Ping of ABC computer company limited . I'm calling on our Mr Wilson the general manager of our company . 
6669," I'm sorry , Mrs Li , Mr Brown is now in a meeting.May I have your number , and ask him to call you back later ? "
6670, I'm afraid Mr Wilson would like to speak to Mr Brown right now.He ' s got an urgent matter to discuss with Mr Brown without delay . 
6671," Ok , then would you please hold the line ? Mr Li , the line is through , Mr Brown is ready answering the call , go ahead . "
6672," Thank you for your assistance , Mr Bush . "
6673, You are welcome . 
6674,"Mr . Li , I come to remind you of the meeting scheduled at 11 o'clock this morning . "
6675," Oh , that's right . And the general manager asked me to report the company's sales for last year at the meeting . "
6676," By the way , the meeting will be held in your office . "
6677," OK , thank you very much . "
6678, Not at all . That's what I should do . 
6679,"Bob , would you come and help me ? "
6680," Of course . What do you want me to do , Mom ? "
6681, Could you hold these packages while I look for the key ? 
6682," Alright , what's in them ? They are so heavy ! "
6683, Just things we need for the picnic tomorrow . 
6684," Well , hurry up and open the door please . I told you these things are heavy . "
6685," I'm sorry , but I just can't find the key . You must have it . "
6686," Oh , yes , it's in my pocket . But how can I get the key while I'm holding all these bags ? "
6687,Excuse me . My name is Dan Ford . I have an appointment with the dentist at 3:30 . 
6688," Yes , Mr . Ford . The dentist will be ready to see you in a minute . Have a seat . "
6689, Thank you . 
6690,Isn't it past your bedtime already ? 
6691, I am not sleepy . 
6692," It's getting late , and you have to wake up early tomorrow . "
6693, There is no way that I can fall asleep right now . 
6694, Try listening to some soft music . 
6695, It won't work . I'm nowhere close to being tired . 
6696," I really don't care , just go to sleep . "
6697," What if I stay up and do something , until I get tired ? "
6698, You'll be up all night if I let you do that . 
6699, I'm going to get to sleep eventually . 
6700," You need to go to sleep now , so go to sleep . "
6701, Good night . 
6702,I want to go try on these clothes . 
6703, What did you find ? 
6704," I found some jeans , and a new blouse . "
6705, Go and try it on . 
6706, What do you think ? 
6707, I love that shirt on you . 
6708, What about the jeans ? 
6709, They don't really fit you right . 
6710, I don't think so either . 
6711, That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though . 
6712," Well , I'll just buy the shirt . "
6713, That would be a good idea . 
6714,"Now , Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I ’ Ve had the chance to look it over and I must say I ’ m quite impressed . "
6715, Thank you very much . I ’ Ve tried to keep it short and clear . If there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me . 
6716," Well yes , I do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background . "
6717," Yes , of course . Well as you can see from the resume I ’ m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , although our family moved to London when I was quite young , at around sixteen . "
6718," Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ? "
6719," Yes precisely . Although I was born in the US , I would definitely call London home . But as you see I ’ Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . My Father was in the oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia too . "
6720, Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood . 
6721, Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ’ m really looking to settle down . 
6722," I see . okay , well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ? "
6723,"Can you tell me , Ms . Smith , about the training programs you initiated this year ? "
6724, We ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained . 
6725, What ’ s the result ? 
6726, We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received . 
6727, That seems very impressive . Good work ! 
6728," Thank you , but I cannot take all the credit . Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level . "
6729,"Well , good morning , Tom . I haven't seen you for a long time . "
6730, I'd been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago . 
6731, What seems to be the trouble now ? 
6732," I feel run down , tired . I've been having headaches almost every day . And I'm not getting as much sleep as usually do . "
6733," Have you been eating properly ? Eating the right kind of food is important for your health , you know . "
6734," Well , I haven't been eating well , I guess . I usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch . "
6735, And what about dinner ? 
6736, Sometimes I'm too tired to eat anything at all . 
6737, That's not good . You don't have a well-balanced diet . Have you been taking vitamin pills ? 
6738, I don't like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first . 
6739,Thank you for purchasing your new mattress with us . 
6740," No , thank you . "
6741," Would you like us to deliver the mattress for you , sir ? "
6742, That would be great . 
6743, When do you want it delivered ? 
6744, I need it delivered tomorrow . Will that be possible ? 
6745, What time exactly ? 
6746, I need it delivered at 12 o'clock . 
6747, We can have it to you at that time . 
6748, That's not a problem ? 
6749, We will deliver your mattress tomorrow at 12 o'clock . 
6750, That's great ! Thank you very much . 
6751,Can I help you ? 
6752," Yes , I'm looking for a house . "
6753, To buy or to rent ? 
6754," Oh , to rent . "
6755, How much do you want to pay ? 
6756, About 300 a month . 
6757," Well , I've got one here . It's 260 a month . "
6758, How big is it ? 
6759," It's got a kitchen , a bathroom , and one bedroom . "
6760," Well , actually I prefer something a bit bigger if that's possible . "
6761," Yes , I think so . There is also an interesting one.It ' s opposite the park . "
6762, How much is it ? 
6763, It's 325 a month . It's the biggest we've got in this area . 
6764, What's it like ? 
6765," Well , There're two bedrooms , a sitting room , a kitchen and a bathroom . "
6766, It sounds interesting . Can I go and see it ? 
6767," Of course , Sir . "
6768,"Would you please mail these letters , Lucy ? "
6769," Yes , Sir . "
6770, These two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . Others are ordinary letters . 
6771," All right , who should I send them to ? "
6772, It ’ s sent to Mr . Charles . I believe he is in London . 
6773," Ok , home or office address ? "
6774," Office address , please . He might be at work when they arrive . "
6775, Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ? 
6776," Yes , it ’ s right . "
6777,What are you reading ? 
6778," Oh , it ’ s the latest novel by Ray Blue . It ’ s a sic-fi thriller . "
6779, I thought he usually wrote horror books . 
6780, He does . He ’ s good at this genre too . It ’ s a captivating read . 
6781, We ’ re going to the bookshop . Would you like to join us ? 
6782," Yes , I would . I need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , I love browsing through the latest paperbacks . "
6783, Me too . I need something to read on the flight to New York . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ’ s books for her daughter . 
6784, I want to look at nelson Mandela ’ s autobiography . 
6785, This is sure to be a worthwhile read . 
6786,"Doctor , I have the worst toothache ! "
6787, How long have you had this pain ? 
6788," For about a week or so , but it ’ s gotten really bad in the last couple of days . "
6789, Did you do anything that might have aggravated your tooth ? 
6790," You know , I was eating jawbreakers in the movies the other day , and I accidentally bit down really hard on one . "
6791, What kind of toothbrush do you use ? 
6792, I just use a regular hard bristle toothbrush . 
6793, Does it bother you when you eat something really cold ? 
6794," Yes , it definitely bothers me more when I do that . "
6795,Good evening . 
6796," Good evening.My wife and I would like a room , please.Is there any room available ? We don't have a reservation . "
6797," Let me see.Yes , we have one room left.You ' re lucky.It ' s the last one . "
6798," Good.We ' re tired after driving all day , and we're looking forward to relaxing in a comfortable room . "
6799, This room has two double beds.It ' s number 56 at the rear of the motel.It ' s quite a comfortable room . 
6800, How much is it for one night ? We only need it for tonight.We ' re going to continue our trip in the morning . 
6801, It's forty-five dollars a night for two.Is anyone else traveling with you ? 
6802," No , it's just the two of us . "
6803, Would you like to pay for the room in cash or with a credit card ? 
6804, Credit card.We don't like to carry much cash with us on our trips . 
6805, Please fill out this registration card.Here is your key.You can park your car in front of our room.Check - out time is noon . 
6806, Thank you very much . 
6807," Thank you , sir.Enjoy your stay with us . "
6808,Let's go to the animal shelter . 
6809, What do you want to do ? 
6810, I want to get a puppy for my son . 
6811, That will make him so happy . 
6812, I'll get him one of those little dogs . 
6813, One that won't grow up too big . 
6814, And eat too much . 
6815, Do you know which one he would like ? 
6816," Oh , yes , I took him there yesterday . He showed me one that he really liked . "
6817, I bet you had to drag him away . 
6818, He wanted to take it home yesterday . 
6819, I wonder what he'll name it . 
6820,Hello . I want to send the computer to my sister in Shanghai by logistics transport . 
6821, OK . Is it in the box ? May I see it ? 
6822, Yes . This is the computer and this is the keyboard and the monitor . 
6823, Is there anything else ? 
6824, There are a mouse and a camera . 
6825, Is that all ? 
6826, Yes . How much is it to send these things to Shanghai by regular delivery ? 
6827," It depends on the weight of these things . Generally speaking , we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram . "
6828," I see . Can you weigh them for me , please ? "
6829, Please go over there to weigh them . 
6830, OK . See you later . 
6831,what happened ? Why didn't he win ? 
6832, didn't you hear ? He was disqualified . 
6833, how did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! 
6834," if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won . "
6835, what ? What kind of drugs was he using ? 
6836, he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . 
6837, I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . 
6838, they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . 
6839, that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . 
6840," I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! "
6841," regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . "
6842," I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs . "
6843, let's hope so . 
6844,I need to use the ATM . 
6845, What ’ s stopping you ? 
6846, I ’ m not sure how . 
6847, I don ’ t understand . 
6848, I ’ Ve never used one before . 
6849, I can help you figure it out . 
6850, What do I have to do ? 
6851, Slide your card into the machine . 
6852, Then what ? 
6853, You need to type your PIN in . 
6854, What do I have to do next ? 
6855," Click on whichever option you want , and you ’ re done . "
6856,"What are you doing ? Checking the "" to do "" list for the wedding ? "
6857, Yep . There's still so much to do ! 
6858, So let's start by checking off what we've already done . 
6859, Did you reconfirm the plane reservations for all the Taiwanese guests ? 
6860," Not yet , I was busy getting that videographer who films stuff for the Net . "
6861, Cool ! I can't believe he agreed to go all the way to Dallas with us ! 
6862, Hey ! We're paying for his ticket ! 
6863,It is my first time coming to China . I want to buy something unique of China to my friends as gifts . 
6864, We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain . Do you like them ? 
6865," Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them . "
6866, You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ? 
6867, Sounds good . May I have a look ? 
6868," Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on . "
6869," They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs . "
6870, All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality . 
6871," Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ? "
6872," This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac . "
6873, Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones . 
6874," OK , I will wrap them for you . "
6875,Can you make out what he's saying ? 
6876," No , it's too loud in here . "
6877,Excuse me . 
6878, Yes ? 
6879," Can you tell me the way to the Peak Tram , please ? "
6880, Certainly . Go along Queen's Road ... 
6881, Along Queen's Road ... 
6882," Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel . "
6883, Right at the Hilton . 
6884," Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral . "
6885, The Cathedral ? 
6886, Yes . Then cross the road at the next traffic lights . The Peak Tram is straight ahead . You can't miss it . 
6887, That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ? 
6888, Yes . Why ? 
6889, Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down . 
6890,"Hi , Nally , are you hungry ? "
6891, I'm starving . Let's go grab a bite . 
6892, Where to ? 
6893, How about Karlis ? 
6894, Are you kidding ? That place is too ritzy for lunch . 
6895, True . ok Let's go to Grumose ? 
6896," Same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg . "
6897, I guess it is a little pricy . 
6898, Let's stop it at Multicolor for a quick lunch .. 
6899," That will be Ok . Come on , I can't wait to chow down . "
6900," That was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy . "
6901, Is that why you stiffed the waiter ? 
6902," You got it . All right , Let's go back to school . "
6903,"Good morning , sir . "
6904, Good morning . I'd like a business suit made with this material . 
6905, Do you have a particular style in mind ? 
6906," The kind that never goes out of fashion , I guess . "
6907, I think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes . 
6908, I'm sure you're right . I just dread the idea of making a new suit every year . 
6909, The changes are usually not that dramatic . We just got some pictures of the latest fashion . Would you like to take a look ? 
6910, Good . I think I'll choose this single breasted one . When can I get it ? 
6911, Next Friday . 
6912, Thank you . 
6913,"Oh , gosh ! I feel everything around me is against me . "
6914, Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 . 
6915," Well , I am all ears . Maybe they are helpful . "
6916," Firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . And secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . The last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age . "
6917," I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it . "
6918, Good luck to us . 
6919,"Look , Mary ! There are so many people over there ! "
6920," Oh , I remember , there is a job fair in the personnel market . "
6921, I have never been to the personnel market . 
6922, Really ? I have been there several times . 
6923, Are there many employers ? 
6924, Yes . The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers . 
6925," So there will be many large companies in the personnel market , right ? "
6926," Yes , there are many famous corporations . "
6927, When will there be a job fair ? 
6928, Every Saturday and Sunday 
6929, Do I need to pay to go into the personnel market ? 
6930," No , it's free . "
6931, How about going there to have a look now ? 
6932," OK , let's go . "
6933,Could you show me the T-shirt on the model ? 
6934," Here you are . We have three different colors , white , blue and pink . "
6935, What's the price ? 
6936, $ 12 . 
6937, Can you make it any cheaper ? 
6938, It is cheap . 
6939, I'll take it if you give me a discount . 
6940, $ 10 . That's the best I can do . 
6941, OK . I'll take the blue one . 
6942,"Hello , again . Did you discuss everything with your colleagues ? "
6943," Yes , yes . It seems that everything is settled . "
6944, Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid ? 
6945," We have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts , whether they are currently with this bank or not . "
6946, That's not a problem . 
6947," Of course , if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank , or open new accounts with you . "
6948, Thank you very much . We always welcome new customers . 
6949,I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking . 
6950, We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments . 
6951," I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house . "
6952, We need to find a good realtor . 
6953," Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . "
6954, What do you mean ? 
6955," Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . "
6956, But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles . 
6957," Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them . "
6958," I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has "
6959," Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own.And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us . "
6960, So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? 
6961, It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . 
6962, And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? 
6963," Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . "
6964, Why ? 
6965," Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . "
6966, Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . 
6967, It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . 
6968, I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like . 
6969, Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store . 
6970,I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening.My wife is terribly ill . 
6971, Sorry to hear that . 
6972, How about next week ? 
6973," Fine , we'll be expecting you then . "
6974,Which restaurant do you prefer ? 
6975, I'd like to taste Mexican food . 
6976, How about the one on Baker Street ? 
6977," Oh , I've never seen a better Mexican restaurant . "
6978,The numbers in this table don't seem to be in accord with reality . 
6979," I know , but these are the figures that we came up with . "
6980,"Oh , so the zoo is over there . Thank you so much for your help . "
6981, You ’ re welcome . Can I ask you what brings you to China ? 
6982, I ’ m actually travelling around Asia . 
6983," Oh , very nice . How long will you be in Beijing ? "
6984, Probably another week . 
6985," Oh , I see . Well , I ’ ll give you my phone number and if you need a guide , please call me . "
6986, Thank you very much . That ’ s very kind . 
6987,"Could you type up this document for me , Sandra ? "
6988," Sure , but I have to finish this report first . "
6989, Never mind . I'll do it . 
6990,Are you interested in mountaineering ? 
6991," Yes , in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you "
6992," I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . I went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains . "
6993, How did you spend the night there ? 
6994," We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful . "
6995," I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country . "
6996," Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't ? "
6997, Yes . It is one of the Five Mountains . 
6998, I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ? 
6999, I'd love to . 
7000,"Sir , what's wrong with you ? "
7001, I have a spasm of nausea and dizziness . 
7002, Have you ever suffered from airsickness before ? You're probably airsick . 
7003," No , this is the first time on a plane . Maybe you are right .. Please get me some pills . "
7004," OK . I will get some for you . There's an airsickness bag behind the seat in front of you.Please wait me for a moment . ( Go away for a few minutes , and now she comes back . ) Here are two pills . And the water is in the glass too.Please take the pills with water . "
7005, Thank you very much . ( Take the pills . ) 
7006, Are you feeling better now ? 
7007, Much better now . Thanks again . 
7008, My pleasure . 
7009,"Hi Bill , it ’ s Jane . "
7010," Jane , I ’ m on the other line , can you hang on for a second ? "
7011, Sure . 
7012," OK , I ’ ll be right back . "
7013,Have you decided what you'd like ? 
7014, Yes . First I'll have tomato juice . 
7015, And then ? 
7016," I'll have the lamb chops , well-done , please . "
7017,"Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ? "
7018, Can you show me some traditional Chinese arts and crafts ? 
7019, Maybe sandalwood fan is good . 
7020, Would you show me some ? 
7021, Of course . 
7022, They really smell fragrant . How much is a real sandalwood fan ? 
7023, The small ones are one hundred yuan for each . And the big ones are two hundred and thirty yuan . 
7024, I'll take two small ones and a big one . 
7025, What else are you interested in ? 
7026, I'm afraid not . 
7027, OK . Here you are . 
7028,Good morning.Mrs.Smith . 
7029," Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother . "
7030," Well , what kind of books does she like ? "
7031, She's very fond of detective stories ? 
7032, I see.Has she read any detective stories ? 
7033," Oh , yes ! "
7034, Do you know if she's read this one ? 
7035," I'm not sure , but she probably won't remember if she has ! She's very forgetful ! "
7036, Ah ! She has a bad memory.How old is she ? 
7037, She's eighty-seven . 
7038, I suggest you take this book.It ' s very exciting . 
7039, Thank you.That ' s a good idea.she likes exciting books.Can you suggest another one ? 
7040,"Hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ? "
7041," Not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements . "
7042, Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air . 
7043," I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world ! "
7044, Really ? What's the series about ? 
7045," Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it . "
7046," It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth . "
7047," I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results . "
7048, Really ? that's interesting ! 
7049," Yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good . "
7050," OK , I'll give it a go . "

7076, Any cigarettes or liquor ? 
7077, I have cigarettes for my own use . 
7078, I think you'll have to pay some duty on these cigarettes because they exceed the quota . And this article is liable for duty . 
7079, How much duty should I pay ? 
7080, One hundred dollars . 
7081, Here is the money . 
7082, Just a moment . I'll make out your duty memo . ( Writing and giving the memo to Mr . Green ) Take it and pay the girl over there .

7084,"So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ... "
7085," We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ... "
7086," That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket . "
7087,"Excuse me , sir , may I talk to you ? "
7088," Bill ! Sure , come on in . What can I do for you ? "
7089," Well sir , as you know , I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years . "

7091," I won ’ t beat around the bush . Sir , I would like a raise . I currently have three companies after me and so I decided to talk to you first . "
7092," A raise ? Son , I would love to give you a raise , but this is just not the right time . "
7093," I understand your position , and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales , but you must also take into consideration my hard work , pro-activeness and loyalty to this company for over a decade . "
7094," Taking into account these factors , and considering I don ’ t want to start a brain drain , I ’ m willing to offer you a ten percent raise and an extra five days of vacation time . How does that sound ? "
7095," Great ! It ’ s a deal ! Thank you , sir ! "
7096," Before you go , just out of curiosity , what companies were after you ? "
7097," Oh , the electric company , gas company and water company ! "

7123, What ? How did that happen ? 
7124," They think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face . "
7125, Wow . What does his look like now ? 
7126," It looks pretty frightening . He doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . Most of his nose and chin are missing too . "
7127, What did he look like before his dog bit his face off ?

7597, Ask away . 
7598, How many hours of the behind-the-wheel course do I need to take ? 
7599, Why do you need to take the course ? 
7600, I want to get my license . 
7601, You have to do six hours behind the wheel . 
7602, How many days do I need to finish the course ? 
7603, You can't finish in less than three days . 
7604, Is that all ? 
7605, There's nothing else to it . 
7606, That sounds easy enough . 
7607,"Peter , go and tidy up your toys now . "
7608," Wait a moment , mom . "
7609," I'm mad ! I said now ! Turn off the TV , and do it now . "
7610," Mom , just ten more minutes . The show is going to be over soon . "
7611," Peter , if you don't do it soon , I will throw your toys in the trash can . "
7612,Excuse me . Do you speak English ? 
7613," Yes , I do . How can I help you ? "
7614," Well , I've just arrived in my room , but there are no instructions in English about the facilities available ! Could you help me for a moment ? "
7615, Of course not . What exactly would you like to know ? 
7616," First , what is the number for room service ? "
7617, It's 1200 . Room service is available 24 hours a day . 
7618," Very good . Now , could you help me to adjust the air conditioning , please ? It's too hot in my room . "
7619," Yes , the control unit is on the wall next to the bathroom . Is 24 ° C all right ? "
7620," Yes , that's perfect . Another thing , if need more items for the mini-bar , which Number should I call ? "
7621, You should call the Housekeeping Department on 2300 . They will replace any stock for you immediately . 
7622," I see . So , is it possible to make international phone calls from my room ? "
7623," That's no problem . Just dial 9 to get an outside line , and then dial the number as usual . "
7624," Well , thanks a lot for your help . "
7625," No problem , sir . If there's anything else you need , you can find me at the desk by the elevator , or you can call housekeeping if I'm not there . "
7626," OK , goodbye . "
7627," Goodbye , sir . "
7628,I need some flowers for my girlfriend . 
7629, No problem . Would you like some artificial carnations ? 
7630," Oh , no . Carnations are not very elegant . Artificial flowers have no passion . "
7631, How much did you want to spend ? 
7632, Money is no object . 
7633, Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily . 
7634, I will take ten . 
7635, Do you want to add some baby's breath for that ? They are equally popular now . 
7636, Of course . Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ? 
7637," Yes , but there is a five dollars delivery charge . "
7638, That's ok . Here is the address . 
7639,Good Morning . What can I do for you ? 
7640," Good Morning , I have a bad cough , and I want to see an internist . "
7641, Do you have a registration card ? 
7642," No , I don ’ t . I ' m a tourist . "
7643," Then you need to register as a new patient . Can I have a look at you ID card ? I need your name , age , occupation , address and contacting number . "
7644, Here you are . 
7645," Thanks . Which kind of medicine do you prefer , western medicine or traditional Chinese medicine ? "
7646, I ’ d like to try traditional Chinese medicine . I heard it really works quite well if you know what you're doing . 
7647," All right . Yes , he does . The registration fee is 7 yuan , please . "
7648,"Hey there Chris , what are you up to ? "
7649, I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models . 
7650," Oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ? "
7651," Yeah , it looks that way . My wife has been bugging me about it . I thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car . "
7652, So this would be your first automobile ? 
7653," That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike . "
7654," Yeah , I think I can understand your wife's position . Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order . "
7655," Oh ... I don't let her ride with me . It's just too dangerous . She takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot . "
7656," So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting ! "
7657," Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility . "
7658, Yeah . I still remember my first car . It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 . I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car . 
7659, I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us . 
7660," Yeah , it is a tough call . Each one has its pros and cons . Are you looking for a sedan ? "
7661," Yes , I'd like a Jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives . "
7662, I'd advise you to listen to your wife . She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice . 
7663,Can I help you ? 
7664, I'd like to send a fax to Shenzhen . 
7665, Is it a photograph or a document ? 
7666, Each of both . 
7667, Could I see both of them ? 
7668, Here you are . 
7669, You can't send this document ; it is not clear enough to send . The photograph is all right . 
7670," Well , how long will it take to arrive in Shenzhen ? "
7671, Couple of minutes . 
7672, Great . How much ? 
7673, 5 $ . You should change another much clearer photograph for fax . 
7674, Thank you . I will deal with it . 
7675,"Good morning , can I see your passport , please ? "
7676, Here you are . 
7677, For business or pleasure ? 
7678, Business . 
7679, Thank you . Have a pleasant stay . 
7680,"Take care , Peter . Don't run so fast . Are you tired ? "
7681," Oh , yes . May I sit on the grass ? "
7682," No , you mustn't sit on the grass . Don't you see the notes ? "
7683," Yes , I can see it . But what's on it ? "
7684, It says ' Keep off the grass ! ' 
7685," Well , there's a bench under the tree . We can sit there . "
7686, Be careful . You can't smoke here . 
7687, Why not ? 
7688, Can't you see the notes there ? It says ' No smoking here ' . 
7689,I'd like a double room . 
7690, Do you have a reservation ? 
7691," Yes , I called you last week from New York . My name is George Lee . "
7692," Wait a second , PLS . Yes , Mr . Lee , we have a room reserved for you . How long do you plan to stay ? "
7693, Probably two days . My wife will join me tomorrow . Then we will decide when to leave for Seattle . 
7694," Would you sign the register , PLS ? "
7695," By the way , does my room have a private bath ? "
7696," Certainly , every room in this hotel has a private bath . "
7697, Does my room have twin beds or a double ? I prefer a room with twin beds . 
7698," Your room has twin beds , Mr.Lee . It also has a view . I am sure you will like it . This is your key . It's on the eighth floor room 801 . The elevator's over there . "
7699," Thank you . One more thing , where is your restaurant ? "
7700," The restaurant is on the second floor . We also have a cafeteria on the top floor . If you would like something to drink , you can either call room service or come down here . The bar is right behind the lobby . "
7701," Thank you , you are very kind ! "
7702, You are welcome ! 
7703,I need to find a bus that'll take me to the Gold Line . 
7704, Where do you live ? 
7705, I live up in Altadena . 
7706, The 264 will take you there . 
7707, It goes all the way there ? 
7708, I know for a fact that it goes to the station . 
7709, What street would I catch it on ? 
7710," If you go to Altadena Drive , you can catch it there . "
7711, I didn't know that bus went to the Gold Line station . 
7712," Yup , it does . "
7713," Well , thanks for letting me know . "
7714, It was my pleasure . 
7715,May I help you ? 
7716, I have a problem . 
7717, What ’ s the problem ? 
7718, Someone else is making charges on my debit card . 
7719, I need to see a statement for your debit card . 
7720, I have it right here . 
7721, Can you show me which charges you ’ re referring to ? 
7722, The last four charges . 
7723, We will need to do an investigation on this . 
7724, How long will that take ? 
7725, We ’ ll have to freeze payment on those charges until the investigation is finished . 
7726, I really appreciate your help . 
7727,Do you think we can go driving right now ? 
7728," Yeah , sure . Let's go . "
7729, Buckle up . 
7730, All right . Now what ? 
7731, Now you put the key in the ignition and start the car . 
7732, Which direction should I take ? 
7733, Make a left on this next street . 
7734, Tell me how far to go . 
7735, Keep going until I tell you to stop . 
7736," Okay , but let me know ahead of time . "

7763," Oh , what's up ? "
7764, I locked myself out . What do you suggest I do ? 
7765," Well , the best thing to do is to go down to the front desk and ask for a duplicate key . "
7766,Ahhs ! I'm beat ! 
7767, What happened to you ? You look like you got hit by a tornado ! 
7768, I just got back from fighting the crowds . 
7769, You mean at the mall ? Was there a sale ? 
7770," Yeah . For five minutes , everything was half off . It was total chaos ... "
7771, Cool ! 
7772," Grabbing , pushing and shoving ... "
7773,Do you have a swimming pool in this hotel ? 
7774," We don't have a swimming pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in the gym . "
7775, I never heard of a swim station . Is that like a train or bus station ?

7777, Holy cow ! I never heard of such a thing . How much do they cost ? 
7778," As a guest , sir , you pay nothing . "

7892," Oh , yes , my daughter bought it yesterday . We call her Lulu . "
7893, It looks so cute . Is it a parrot ? 
7894, Yes . Just look at her colorful feathers . What else can it be ? 
7895, I see . It's interesting that there is also a parrot in my English book . His mane is Polly . 
7896, Really ? A foreign parrot ! 
7897," He can speak English , too . "
7898, Maybe you can teach Lulu some English words . 
7899," Lulu . Lulu . Say hello . hello . Oh , she is so smart . Good bird . "
7900,"my mp3 player is broken , so I want to change it for an mp4 player . Can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ? "
7901, an mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones . 
7902," Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try . "
7903," look at my cell phone . I can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . It's just like a PAD . "
7904," that's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products . "
7905," that's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much . "
7906," yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 . "
7907, that's right . what's the flash memory of your old mp3 ? 
7908, 256MB . 
7909, then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB . 
7910,What can I get you ? 
7911, A cheeseburger and an order of french fries would be great . 
7912, Would you like anything to drink ? 
7913, I feel like having a Coke . 
7914, That's a good idea . I think I'll join you . 
7915,"Mr . Bryant ? Hi , I'm Mike from Florence Incorporated . I'll glad you made it okay . How was your flight ? "
7916," It was pretty bumpy , also a bit long , all together about 5 hours . "

7918, Actually I feel quite rested . I was able to sleep on the plane . 
7919," Good ! Here , let me help you with your bag . Is it your first time to Seattle ? I'd be happy to take you around this city and show you the sights tonight if you're up to it . "
